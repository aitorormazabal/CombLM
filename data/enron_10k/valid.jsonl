{"text": "\nI just wanted to take a moment to personally invite each of you to participate in the e-Speak session this Thursday, May 10 at 10:00 am (CDT).  If you have questions that you'd like to submit in advance, you can do so by visiting e-Speak on the Enron homepage.\n\nI also wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on what's happening within the Program.  Since assuming my new role at the beginning of April, I've been focusing my efforts on meeting with Enron's business unit leaders, and with as many Analysts and Associates as possible.  These activities underscore my priorities in managing the Program - a very strong alignment with Enron's businesses, and frequent / informal communication.\n\nSome of the specific items that we're focused on as a result of your feedback, and that will be communicated in coming weeks include:\n?\timprovements to the PRC process which are in the final stages of development with the business units,\n?\trecruiting goals and strategies for the 2001 recruiting season,\n?\ta series of floor meetings beginning today to visit informally with participants in the Program,\n?\tan updated social schedule that places a priority on interaction among Analysts and Associates, as well as with the business leaders of Enron.\n\nI'm excited that Traci Warner and Ted Bland have joined our team in the Western Hemisphere to lead Recruiting and Career Development respectively.  Together, they bring almost 20 years of Enron business unit experience, and in the case of Traci - experience as an Associate in the Program.  Anna Jansson continues to do an outstanding job leading the Eastern Hemisphere Program, and has been an great source of new ideas.  \n\nWhen I joined Enron in 1992, there were about 25 Analysts and Associates combined, sitting in one group on the 30th floor.  Today, we have over 700 future Innovators and Leaders of Enron in offices around the world.  This Program has been, and will continue to be our most important source of new talent.  I'm very proud to have been asked to take this role, and I look forward to working with each of you.\n\nBilly Lemmons\n"}

{"text": "Hey everyone,\nJust finished working my first full week at Deer Valley.  The resort opened\nfriday and from tues through sunday I worked with the other bakers to get\nitems prepped and inventories stocked up for the mad rush of skiers expected\nover the weekend.\n\nI am enjoying working under the pastry chef at the lodge I am at.  He is\nvery dilligent about coming over and making sure you understand the how's\nand why's of the recipe you are making.  His explanations are scientific\nwhen they need to be and straightforward when they don't need to be long and\ndrawn out.  I'm confident that I will learn a lot from the other chefs and\nbakers there as well.\n\nThe first few days were very frustrating.  There are a group of bakers,\nlevel 3's, who work at the lodge every winter and supervise the new bakers.\nThere were a few tasks that I was assigned to do along w/ these level 3\nbakers.  We were cutting cakes in half and I was doing it the way Patrick\nalways showed me and she said that I shouldn't do it that way ...to do it\nanother way.  Then one of the girls at my level with the $40k diploma from\nthe CIA asked me if I had ever cut a cake before (like asking someone if\nthey are retarded).  I couldn't see straight I was so frustrated.  Later, I\nwas shaping baguettes..again..the way I learned...and the level 3 told me to\ndo it another way...and that our boss Steve who studied bread could show me\nlater since he knows so much.  Well when he came over later ...he did it\nalmost exactly the same way I did.  There are lots of stories like this from\nthose first few days.  I had to bite my tongue a lot.  One girl claims she\ncan tell when bread is done proofing by looking at it...and doesn't have to\ntouch it (why wouldn't you touch it..thats the best part).  I might believe\nthat from someone in their 40's but not a 20 something who has only been\nbaking a few years.  So I went home completely frustrated the first 3 days,\nbut I had to remind myself that school was 2yrs ago for me and for many of\nthese girls school was last month or a few months ago.\n\nWe have a lot of people in the kitchen who hail from the CIA, which for\nthose of you who might not know..it is a school that cranks out culinary\ngrads for around $40,000 for the entire program.  People keep asking me if I\nam doing my externship from the CIA......kind of like when I was at enron\nand people kept asking me if I was in the analyst/associate\nprogram...equally annoying.  BUT, since I am dilligently learning to look at\nthe bright side of everything...the good part about having all of these\nculinary school people around is that it makes the environment more\nprofessional and competitive...which in the long run is a great environment\nfor me becauses it pushes me to be that much better than everyone else.  And\nthough I look at some of these 23yr olds who can technically do everything I\ncan do at such a younger age...though I catch myself wishing I had done this\na long time ago,  I am glad I am doing this at a time in life when I have a\nton more maturity and a vision of what I want to do with this experience.\n\nToday and tomorrow are my off days.  For my friends who are living\nvicariously through me...yes I have been skiing and hopefully will get out\nthere later on this afternoon.  Tomorrow I have an interview with another\nbakery in town that I am considering working part time at.  Hope everyone is\nwell, especially my friends at ENE.\nBest!\nMo.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp"}

{"text": "\nToday we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  \n\nJeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.\n\nI know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.\n\nPlease join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."}

{"text": "Intercepted Memo From Osama Bin Laden \nHere is a memo we have Intercepted from Osama Bin Laden to all of his\nCavemates. \n\n\nTo: Cavemates\n\nFrom: Bin Laden, Osama \n\nSent: Monday, December 10, 2001 8:17 AM \n\nSubject: The Cave \n\nHi guys. We've all been putting in long hours in this conflict but we've\nfinally come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for\nputting up the poster that says \"There is no I in team\" as well as the one\nthat says \"Hang In There, Baby.\" That cat is hilarious. However, while we\nare fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave. And frankly\nI have a few concerns. \nFirst of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we\nshould be even more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey, you\ndon't want to be stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave daily.\n\nI've posted a sign-up sheet near the main cave opening. \nSecond, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to\nscare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That means that while we're\ntaping, please do not ride your razor scooter in the background. Just while\nwe're taping. Thanks. \nThird point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by edict, we're not\nsupposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene,\nespecially after mealtime. We're all in this together. \nFourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly wrote \"Osama\" on\nthe front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my Cheez-Its were gone.\nConsideration. That's all I'm saying. \nFinally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in disguise trying\nto infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First\npatrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and the new guy Richard. \n\nLove you lots. \n\nOsama B. "}

{"text": "\nDear Colleagues,\n\nWe know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. \n\nMeanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.\n\nI am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.\n\nDavid Oxley\nHead, Human Resources\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nAccess Cards\n\nThere will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.\n\nEmployees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.\n\nThere will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.\n\nIt is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.\n\nAccessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:\n5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , \nThe Sky Ring \nBody Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.\n\nRestricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:\nEnron Center South, 8th and 9th floors\nEnron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor \nArdmore Data Center.\n\nEmployees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.\n\nEstate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

(it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. \n\nObviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.\nOne question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.

It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.\n\nPurpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our \"live\" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:\n\nTest the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)\nProvide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup\nDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week\n\nNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:\n\nCredit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:\nProfile tests for \"external\" customers (role-played by Originators)\nProfile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)\nData and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems\n\nTraders and Originators:\nTraders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.\nOriginators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.\n\nInformation Technology:\nWill assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.\nAfter the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books\nWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.\n\n\nNext steps \n\nTraders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.\nOriginators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.\nUBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). \n\n\nRegards,\nDave Forster\n713.853.1861\nE-Mail:\tDavid.Forster@enron.com"}

{"text": "John and Dutch -\n\nThis email is sent to discuss what is needed with respect to NYMEX quotes from the broker market.  Simply put, we need quotes on every forward term for which we currently have positions.  It seems that the best way to obtain relevant information would be to ask for the following:\n\n1.  Annual quotes (a quote for 2003, a quote for 2004, etc.)\n\n2.  Seasonal quotes (winter '03, summer '04, etc.)\n\n\nIn short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.  I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.  We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.  We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.\n\nAlso, I am aware that our current position doesn't give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.  However, this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.  Please do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.  Additionally, we need to get quotes from as many different brokers as possible to help verify pricing.  \n\nPlease let me know if the brokers are not accomodating your requests; we may need to ask John or Louise to place calls into the brokers to move this process along.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, you can normally find me in the \"war room\" next to Louise's office.  If I'm not there, please call me at (713) 927-3003 or at ext 53923.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nJay"}

{"text": "\nwhat kind of communist company do you work for that prohibits\nreading the usa today?  can't read usa today but i bet porn is\nallright.  regardless i cut and pasted it for you.\n\n\n\nThe NCAA is expected to move closer next week toward new\nguidelines that one official estimates could pare as many as 20\nschools from college football's big-time Division I-A.\n\nThe association's Management Council, meeting in Indianapolis on\nMonday and Tuesday, will weigh proposed scheduling, attendance,\nscholarship and other requirements designed to weed out I-A\npretenders and discourage lower-division wannabes. Further votes\nare scheduled for the spring and, if ultimately approved, the\nmeasures could go into effect in 2004.\n\nThey would require I-A schools to hand out at least 90% (or 76.5)\nof the 85 football scholarships allotted to major-college programs\nin a given season and offer a minimum of 16 sports (including at\nleast four men's and six women's) and 200 scholarships overall.\n\nMore problematic for some schools, however, could be additional\nstipulations that football programs play at least five regular-\nseason home games vs. I-A opponents each season and average no\nless than 15,000 in attendance. Twenty-eight of the 115 I-A\nprograms failed to meet one of those criteria over the past two\nseasons, and several schools - including many in the Mid-American\nConference and the Sun Belt - fell short of both.\n\nMAC member Kent State, for example, met four I-A opponents at home\na year ago and will play only four again this season, and the\nGolden Flashes averaged a division-low 8,473 for home games vs.\nmajor-college opponents the past two seasons. They drew just 2,973\nfor last week's victory over Northern Illinois.\n\n\"The track it's on right now, I would see maybe 20\" schools\nfalling out of Division I-A, Management Council chairman Charles\nHarris, commissioner of the I-AA Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.\n\nIn danger of falling from I-A\n\nAmong other things, if the NCAA approves proposed new criteria for\nmembership in Division I-A, schools will have to play at least\nfive home games vs. I-A opponents every year and average at least\n15,000 in attendance - probably over a rolling two-year period.\n\nAveraged fewer than five home games vs. I-A:\n\n* Mid-American Conference (9): Ball State, Bowling Green, Buffalo,\nCentral Michigan, Kent State, Miami (Ohio), Northern Illinois,\nOhio U., Western Michigan.\n\n* Sun Belt (7): Arkansas State, Idaho, Louisiana-Lafayette,\nLouisiana-Monroe, Middle Tennessee State, New Mexico State, North\nTexas.\n\n* Western Athletic (5): Boise State, Louisiana Tech, Rice, San\nJose State, Texas-El Paso.\n\n* Conference USA (3): Houston, Southern Mississippi, UAB.\n\n* Independents (2): Central Florida, Utah State\n\nAveraged less than 15,000 in home attendance:\n\n* Kent State\n\n* Eastern Michigan\n\n* Middle Tennessee\n\n* Akron\n\n* Bowling Green\n\n* Northern Illinios\n\n* Arkansas State\n\n* Louisville-Monroe\n\n* San Jose State\n\n* Buffalo\n\n\n---------- Original Message ----------------------------------\nFrom: \"Mark Molnar\" <MarkM@cajunusa.com>\nDate: Thu, 18 Oct 2001 10:47:48 -0500\n\n>My company blocks this website, what does it say?\n>\n>>>> \"siva66\" <siva66@mail.ev1.net> 10/18/01 10:28AM >>>\n>pretty damn embarrasing if you ask me.  maybe we can dominate\n>youngstown stae.\n>\n>\n>---------- Original Message ----------------------------------\n>From: Brian Dunlavy <bwdunlavy@yahoo.com>\n>Date: Thu, 18 Oct 2001 08:11:33 -0700 (PDT)\n>\n>>http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2001-10-17-\n>divisionia.htm\n>>\n>>The end of the program is coming...\n>>\n>>How embarrassing is this?\n>>\n>>\n>>__________________________________________________\n>>Do You Yahoo!?\n>>Make a great connection at Yahoo!

{"text": "Hi Dutch --\n\nSince you offered to answer some of my questions over e-mail, I will take\nyou up on it!    I would still like to get some of your time Monday or\nTuesday to go into more detailed discussion.\n\nQuestion 1:\nWhen we talk about \"the market\" reacting to events, what are the prices\nthat we are talking about? From a simulation standpoint, I am trying to\nfigure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many\nevents.  Is it the forward curve? Is it the spot market price?  Is the\nbid/offer prices for the various instruments? And, if we are having users\ntrade basis, we will need different prices for different locations, right?\n\nQuestion 2:\nGiven that the calculation of VaR is rather involved, we decided that it\nwould not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model.\nHowever, we understand that the user needs to 1) know their VaR and 2) know\nthat they need to make sure they stay within their VaR limit.  So, we will\nneed to set a VaR limit for the user and \"fake\" the individual VaR to\nreflect their risk exposure.\n\nI had a talk with Erro McLaughlin about this.  He made a good point that if\nour user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a VaR is\ncalculated, will they know how to control their VaR, i.e. if a user sees\nthat he is over his VaR limit, what should he do to get it back within the\nlimit.  Is is as simple as not being too long or too short? And if that is\nthe case, would it be sufficient to use position reports/tallies as a proxy\nfor risk exposure, instead of VaR?\n\nOne possible way to fake VaR may be to adjust the VaR number to reflect how\nexposed the user is. So if they are X dollars long, they have a VaR of Y.\nIf they change their position so that they are now 1.5X long, they have a\nVaR of 1.5Y.  Perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account\nmarket volatility.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n\nLastly, when could you meet with me next week? I would really like to meet\non Tuesday, if possible.\n\nThanks so much for your time, Dutch.\n\nHave a terrific weekend!\nAnn\n\n\nThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\nprivileged or confidential information.

All players CAN be claimed on a first come  first served basis, after waiver transactions complete on Friday at 9am in their  pre determined order.  Therefore, players WILL NOT be frozen until the  following weeks transaction period.  If there is a need for a rule change,  we can put it to vote next year.  Please attempt to make all transactions  via the web site in the future.  If you have difficulty, then email me with  your transaction.  All players that were dropped last week are now  available to be claimed on a first come, first served basis.\n \nFor those that are new or may have forgotten, there  is a $2 fee/transaction that will be due at the end of the season.

Tamim is an\nAfghani-American writer.  He is also one of the most brilliant people I\nknow in this life.  When he writes, I read.  When he talks, I listen.\nHere is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are in.\n\n\n\nDear friend and whoever else is on this email thread:\nI've been hearing a lot of talk about \"bombing Afghanistan back to the\nStone Age.\" Ronn Owens, on KGO Talk Radio today, allowed that this would\nmean killing innocent people, people who had nothing to do with this\natrocity, but \"we're at war, we have to accept collateral damage. What\nelse can we do?\"  Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether\nwe \"have the belly to do what must be done.\"\nAnd I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am\nfrom Afghanistan, and even though I've lived here for 35 years I've never\nlost track of what's going on there. So I want to tell anyone who will\nlisten how it all looks from where I'm standing.\nI speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden. There is no\ndoubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in\nNew York. I agree that something must be done about those monsters.\nBut the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan.  They're not even the\ngovernment of Afghanistan.  The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics\nwho took over Afghanistan in 1997. Bin Laden is a political criminal with\na plan.  When you think Taliban, think Nazis. When you think Bin Laden,\nthink Hitler. And when you think \"the people of Afghanistan\" think \"the\nJews in the concentration camps.\"   It's not only that the Afghan people\nhad nothing to do with this atrocity. They were the first victims of the\nperpetrators. They would exult if someone would come in there, take out\nthe Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in\ntheir country. Some say, why don't the Afghans rise up and overthrow the\nTaliban? The answer is, they're starved, exhausted, hurt, incapacitated,\nsuffering.  A few years ago, the United Nations estimated that there are\n500,000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan-a country with no economy, no\nfood.  There are millions of widows.  And the Taliban has been burying\nthese widows alive in mass graves.  The soil is littered with land mines,\nthe farms were all destroyed by the Soviets.  These are a few of the\nreasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban.\nWe come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone\nAge.\nTrouble is, that's been done. The Soviets took care of it already.\nMake the Afghans suffer? They're already suffering. Level their houses?\nDone. Turn their schools into piles of rubble? Done.  Eradicate their\nhospitals? Done. Destroy their infrastructure? Cut them off from medicine\nand\nhealth care? Too late. Someone already did all that. New bombs would only\nstir\nthe rubble of earlier bombs.  Would they at least get the Taliban? Not\nlikely.\nIn today's Afghanistan, only the Taliban eat, only they have the means to\nmove around.\nThey'd slip away and hide. Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled\norphans,\nthey don't move too fast, they don't even have wheelchairs. But flying over\n\nKabul and dropping bombs wouldn't really be a strike against the criminals\nwho did this horrific thing. Actually it would only be making common cause\nwith the Taliban-by raping once again the people they've been raping all\nthis time\nSo what else is there? What can be done, then? Let me now speak with true\nfear and trembling. The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with\nground troops. When people speak of \"having the belly to do what needs to\nbe done\" they're thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as\nneeded.  Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing\ninnocent people. Let's pull our heads out of the sand. What's actually on\nthe table is Americans dying. And not just because some Americans would\ndie fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Laden's hideout. It's\nmuch bigger than that folks. Because to get any troops to Afghanistan,\nwe'd have to go through Pakistan. Would they let us? Not likely. The\nconquest of Pakistan would have to be first. Will other Muslim nations\njust stand by? You see where I'm going. We're flirting with a world war\nbetween Islam and the West.\nAnd guess what: that's Bin Laden's program. That's exactly what he wants.\nThat's why he did this.  Read his speeches and statements. It's all right\nthere.  He really believes Islam would beat the west. It might seem\nridiculous, but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the\nWest, he's got a billion soldiers.  If the west wreaks a holocaust in\nthose lands, that's a billion people with nothing left to lose, that's\neven better from Bin Laden's point of view.  He's probably wrong, in the\nend the west would win, whatever that would mean, but the war would last\nfor years and millions would die, not just theirs but ours. Who has the\nbelly for that? Bin Laden does. Anyone else?\n\nTamim Ansary\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

We had people play last night that could barely run, yet you can't show up or even try to get yourself a sub because of a little 'pussy elbow'.  Maybe if you saw how Ernie's entire hamstring turned purple after he severely strained it last week you would feel bad about not playing.  He showed up and hobbled around the field for us.  I can't walk without pain in my knee, but I showed up.  I had to catch and bat left handed cuz I couldn't put any weight on it, but I showed up. Hell, John probably would have tried to play if he thought it would help the team.  I'm not going to talk to you for a few days...maybe three.  You are lucky we dragged dutch out of retirement last night.  Thanks again for playing last night Dutch.  Nice 3 wood shots!!!!!!!"}

{"text": "\nwhat kind of communist company do you work for that prohibits\nreading the usa today?  can't read usa today but i bet porn is\nallright.  regardless i cut and pasted it for you.\n\n\n\nThe NCAA is expected to move closer next week toward new\nguidelines that one official estimates could pare as many as 20\nschools from college football's big-time Division I-A.\n\nThe association's Management Council, meeting in Indianapolis on\nMonday and Tuesday, will weigh proposed scheduling, attendance,\nscholarship and other requirements designed to weed out I-A\npretenders and discourage lower-division wannabes. Further votes\nare scheduled for the spring and, if ultimately approved, the\nmeasures could go into effect in 2004.\n\nThey would require I-A schools to hand out at least 90% (or 76.5)\nof the 85 football scholarships allotted to major-college programs\nin a given season and offer a minimum of 16 sports (including at\nleast four men's and six women's) and 200 scholarships overall.\n\nMore problematic for some schools, however, could be additional\nstipulations that football programs play at least five regular-\nseason home games vs. I-A opponents each season and average no\nless than 15,000 in attendance. Twenty-eight of the 115 I-A\nprograms failed to meet one of those criteria over the past two\nseasons, and several schools - including many in the Mid-American\nConference and the Sun Belt - fell short of both.\n\nMAC member Kent State, for example, met four I-A opponents at home\na year ago and will play only four again this season, and the\nGolden Flashes averaged a division-low 8,473 for home games vs.\nmajor-college opponents the past two seasons. They drew just 2,973\nfor last week's victory over Northern Illinois.\n\n\"The track it's on right now, I would see maybe 20\" schools\nfalling out of Division I-A, Management Council chairman Charles\nHarris, commissioner of the I-AA Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.\n\nIn danger of falling from I-A\n\nAmong other things, if the NCAA approves proposed new criteria for\nmembership in Division I-A, schools will have to play at least\nfive home games vs. I-A opponents every year and average at least\n15,000 in attendance - probably over a rolling two-year period.\n\nAveraged fewer than five home games vs. I-A:\n\n* Mid-American Conference (9): Ball State, Bowling Green, Buffalo,\nCentral Michigan, Kent State, Miami (Ohio), Northern Illinois,\nOhio U., Western Michigan.\n\n* Sun Belt (7): Arkansas State, Idaho, Louisiana-Lafayette,\nLouisiana-Monroe, Middle Tennessee State, New Mexico State, North\nTexas.\n\n* Western Athletic (5): Boise State, Louisiana Tech, Rice, San\nJose State, Texas-El Paso.\n\n* Conference USA (3): Houston, Southern Mississippi, UAB.\n\n* Independents (2): Central Florida, Utah State\n\nAveraged less than 15,000 in home attendance:\n\n* Kent State\n\n* Eastern Michigan\n\n* Middle Tennessee\n\n* Akron\n\n* Bowling Green\n\n* Northern Illinios\n\n* Arkansas State\n\n* Louisville-Monroe\n\n* San Jose State\n\n* Buffalo\n\n\n---------- Original Message ----------------------------------\nFrom: \"Mark Molnar\" <MarkM@cajunusa.com>\nDate: Thu, 18 Oct 2001 10:47:48 -0500\n\n>My company blocks this website, what does it say?\n>\n>>>> \"siva66\" <siva66@mail.ev1.net> 10/18/01 10:28AM >>>\n>pretty damn embarrasing if you ask me.  maybe we can dominate\n>youngstown stae.\n>\n>\n>---------- Original Message ----------------------------------\n>From: Brian Dunlavy <bwdunlavy@yahoo.com>\n>Date: Thu, 18 Oct 2001 08:11:33 -0700 (PDT)\n>\n>>http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2001-10-17-\n>divisionia.htm\n>>\n>>The end of the program is coming...\n>>\n>>How embarrassing is this?\n>>\n>>\n>>__________________________________________________\n>>Do You Yahoo!?\n>>Make a great connection at Yahoo!

{"text": "ST. MARTINVILLE, La. -- Former Dallas Cowboys star Nate Newton was\narrested when police confiscated 213 pounds of marijuana from a\nvan on a highway.\n\nNewton and two others were charged Sunday with possession with\nintent to distribute marijuana, Trooper Willie Williams said\nTuesday. A fourth person, arrested in a separate vehicle with\n$18,000, was charged with conspiracy to possess narcotics.\n\nAll four were in the St. Martin Parish Jail on Tuesday with bail\nset at $200,000 each.\n\nNewton is a six-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman who helped Dallas\nwin three Super Bowls. He spent 14 seasons in the NFL, 13 with\nDallas. He retired last year after a season with Carolina.\n\nWilliams said a state police patrol pulled over a van for a\ntraffic violation on Sunday about 6 a.m. east of Lafayette.\n\n\"The driver seemed nervous and gave consent to search the van,\"\nWilliams said. He did not say who was driving.\n\nCardboard boxes filled with 213 pounds of marijuana were in the\nvan, Williams said.\n\nNewton, who lives in East Ellijay, Ga., was arrested along with\nFaye Cleveland, 46, and Marva Johnson Waye, 49, both of\nJacksonville, Fla. All three were charged with possession with\nintent to distribute marijuana.\n\nThe driver of a pickup truck, Ricky Glenn Williams, 46, of\nQuinlan, Texas, was charged with conspiracy to possess narcotics,\npolice said. The $18,000 that was in the truck with him was\nseized, the trooper said.\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\nSent via the EV1 webmail system at mail.ev1.net\n\n\n\n                   "}

He is shocked to see teammate Edgerrin\nJames starring in the cleverly titled Vivid TV feature \"Ease It\nIn, James\". So THAT's why The Edge chose not to attend those mini-\ncamps over the summer.\n\nJax at Baltimore: Fans who wear the jerseys of injured Jags\nplayers are inexplicably stricken with similar injuries. Anyone\nwearing a #82 Jimmy Smith jersey contracts horrific intestinal\nbleeding, and those with #8 Mark Brunell jerseys are all blind-\nsided by 350-pound black men. One man wearing a #28 Fred Taylor\njersey crumbles to the ground after shredding his groin, sending\nnacho cheese and peanuts flying into the air. One of the airborne\npeanuts scratches the cornea of a fan wearing an old Orlando Brown\njersey, much like the penalty flag that ended that player's career\nin Cleveland a couple of years ago.\n\nMinnesota at Tampa Bay: Desperate for talent at RB, Vikings coach\nDennis Green (a master of fathering illegitimate children) spends\nthe week collecting baby batter from the NFL's best running backs\nof all time in the hopes of bioengineering a replacement for\nRobert Smith.\n\nSF at Chicago: Niners QB and flaming pillow biter Jeff Garcia\nunveils his new limp-wristed passing style, which he modeled after\nLamar's javelin throw in \"Revenge of the Nerds\". At halftime\nGarcia is joined by Booger, Poindexter, Takashi, and Wermzer to\nperform the famous rap-rock song from the Adams College Homecoming\nCarnival, which begins with the brilliant lyrics \"Now clap your\nhands everybody, and everybody clap your hands.\"\n\nNew Orleans at St. Louis: Kurt Warner's endorsement of Campbell's\nChunky Soup backfires when his pre-game meal of Hearty New England\nChowder results in explosive diarrhea in the middle of a play.\nThis unfortunate case of \"faucet ass\" forces Warner to leave the\ngame with an embarrassing brown splotch on the seat of his uniform\npants. The incident proves to be fortuitous, however, as Warner\nlater inks a multi-million dollar deal to become the spokesman for\nOops, I Crapped My Pants.\n\nJets at Carolina: The Panthers unveil a new promotion with a local\ncar dealership in which a fan gets the chance to win a new car.\nThe fan is shown three cars and in order to win he must correctly\nguess which one has a Rae Carruth cardboard cut-out hidden away in\nthe trunk. If Rae springs out of the trunk, you win!\n\nArizona at Dallas: Last week's near disaster in which Cowboys\nkicker Tim Seder was nearly trampled during warm-ups by a horse\nforces the team to cancel its plans for the Cowboys Banditos Biker\nSquad, which was supposed to feature a team of Mexican outlaws on\nHarleys who zip around the field distributing t-shirts to kids in\nthe stands.\n\nOakland at Philly: Just in time for Halloween, Raiders coach Jon\nGruden releases a new line of masks featuring his trademark facial\nexpressions in response to various situations. The first round of\nmasks to go on sale includes \"Jon finds out his new puppy got run\nover in the driveway\", \"Jon learns he was actually born as a\ngirl\", \"Jon catches Tyrone Wheatley and Charles Woodson double\nteaming his wife\", and \"Jon finds pubic hairs in his soup at a\nrestaurant.\"\n\nBuffalo at San Diego: Buffalo management captures Osama bin Laden\nand insists that they will turn him over to authorities only if\nDoug Flutie comes back to be their QB in place of Rob Johnson.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________\nSent via the EV1 webmail system at mail.ev1.net\n\n\n\n"}

{"text": "OK folks, \nHere's the scoop on Drallion Tickets. \n- In order to give the momma to be enough time to recover (she is due on the 11th), I began my search for shows beginning on Jan 13th.  2 days should be enough time right?  I'm kidding, I actually began searching for shows on Jan 25th (Friday) \n- Searching for tix on line it appears that Friday and Saturday tix would be hard to get for a big group.  I have contacted group sales to see if they have anything available. \n- There are weekday shows that we may want to consider.  There are still plenty of good seats for some of the weekday shows (even for a large group).  Unfortunately, the maximum number of tix I can get through direct online is 12.

Good seats are $60.  These are tix located directly in front of the stage.  The cheapest seats (limited view) are $40. \nPlease let me know if you are still in and if you have any preference on seat location ($) and date (day). \nPlease reply ASAP so that I can order these tix. \nernie \nThis is a list of people that have showed interest in going: \nKevin and Nancy \nDutch and Kay \nMark and Bebe \nErnie and Melissa \nJoe and Yesenia (Xavier?) \nRicardo and Joann "}

There is no=\n reason for panic as the scenario shall play out like this.  The Longhorns =\nand Huskies will be tied at 28 late in the fourth quarter of the Holiday Bo=\nwl.  Applewhite will lead the Horns on a miraculous 50-yd drive down to the=\n Washington 30-yd line with only 10 sec left on the clock.  Between plays A=\npplewhite will look over at the Golden Boy standing on the sideline and rec=\nognize that the time is now for Simms to fulfill his Destiny.  As the Star =\nWars music plays in the background, Applewhite will lead the Horns up to th=\ne line of scrimmage.  In Obi-Wan Kenobi-to-Darth Vader fashion, Major will =\nlook across the line at the Huskies defense and say,\"Strike me down and I s=\nhall become more powerful than you could ever imagine.\"  As the ball is sna=\npped, Major drops back in the pocket and then stands motionless, allowing t=\nhe Huskies linebackers to pummel him.  Simms screams, \"NO!!!\" as Major lies=\n motionless on the field.  Major is carted off the field with numerous brok=\nen bones while the Golden Boy takes his warm-up tosses on the sideline.  Th=\ne clock sits at 4 seconds remaining as Simms trots onto the field.  Only en=\nough time for one try at the endzone.  Simms walks to the line, takes the s=\nnap and begins to look over the field.  As Simms prepares to unload a blazi=\nng bullet pass right into the hands of a Washington safety, he hears Major'=\ns voice in his mind, \"Use the force Chris, read the field\".  The Golden Boy=\n brings his throwing arm down, the Star Wars music plays once again, and Ch=\nris looks over the entire field for the first time since playing the School=\n for the Blind back in Jersey.  Simms spots Roy Williams wide open, closes =\nhis eyes, and fires a 30 yd touchdown pass for the victory.  And hence the =\nlegend of the Golden Boy is alive and well.\n\nStay tuned for the next episode as Chris learns that his father is not ex-p=\nlayer/broadcaster Phil Simms, but is actually broadcaster Dennis Miller"}

{"text": "Alright, I'll throw my two cents in.  Dutch is right, Ricky is right, Ernie is right, as is Kevin and everyone else who responded.  We are an extremely fortunate bunch.  We tend to be extraordinarily resilient and forgiving.  I took a bunch of flak over the past three years for my frequent absences, however, they were not absences because of a flippant attitude.  Law school took its toll as did accommodating Jo's set of friends.  My time had to be split many ways and it can be difficult to juggle everything as I am sure you are all aware.  But, mind you, I was not absent because I didn't care, or found something better to do.  It was never because I didn't want to.  At the risk of this becoming even more of a love in, you guys should know, as this is apparently the only opportunity we've taken, you are my friends.  And I would like to keep it that way.  I have to go now.  Mark says that that the keyboard placement blocks his access to my balls.\n\nJerry"}

Robert Collins, Jr., President\n\nSUBJECT:\tEXCHANGE TO INTRODUCE HENRY HUB SWAPS; LARGE ORDER EXECUTION\nAND EXTENDED MONTHS IN NATURAL GAS FUTURES AND OPTIONS\n____________________________________________________________________________\n_____\n\nThe New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced an expanded slate of\nnatural gas products and services that it plans to introduce on an expedited\nbasis, including an electronically traded, cleared Henry Hub swaps contract\nfor the December 3 trading session, which begins with the NYMEX ACCESS\n\nsession on Sunday night, December 2; listings of additional natural gas\nfutures contracts as far as six years out beginning with the NYMEX ACCESS\n\nsession tonight; extended natural gas options contracts beginning with the\nMonday open outcry session; and large order execution (LOX) in the first two\nmonths of the natural gas futures contract also beginning tomorrow.\n\nThe contract specifications for the Henry Hub swaps contract will closely\nparallel those of the Henry Hub futures contract other than it will be\nfinancially settled, based on the final settlement price of the Henry Hub\nfutures contract.  The trading symbol will be NN.  Trading will begin at 7\nPM Sunday night, with a pre-opening session beginning at 3 PM.\n\nThe Exchange currently lists the natural gas futures contract for 36\nconsecutive months and will list an additional 36 consecutive months\nbeginning tomorrow.  The Exchange currently lists 12 consecutive months of\nnatural gas options and eight additional quarterly contracts on a\nMarch/June/September/December cycle, and, on Monday, will add 12 additional\nquarterly contracts on the same cycle.  The Henry Hub swaps contract will be\navailable for the closest 72 consecutive months.\n\nLOX will be permitted throughout the open outcry sessions, except during the\nclosing range. Under the new procedures, orders for a minimum of 250\ncontracts and a maximum of 5,000 contracts will be permitted outside of the\nbid/ask spread for smaller trades, as long as the trade is within the\nsession's maximum price fluctuation limits.\n\nFloor traders wishing to participate in a LOX market on behalf of a customer\nor themselves must verbally submit a request for quote (RFQ) to an Exchange\nemployee, who will act as the LOX book holder, stipulating the delivery\nmonth and number of contracts involved. The book holder will only recognize\ninitial responses that are for the full amount of the RFQ. Once a response\nto the RFQ is formally recognized, the requesting member has 30 seconds to\nreact to the market.\n\nThere will be a $2.50 per contract charge for any RFQ that receives a\nresponding quote. If the RFQ results in a trade, the fee will be reduced to\n$1.50 per contract.\n\nMembers trading for their own accounts may participate in a trade subsequent\nto the initial response, but the member who first responded with the best\nbid or offer for the large order will never receive less than a 50%\nallocation of a completed trade.\n\nIn addition to formally recognizing the participants involved in a LOX\norder, the book holder will be responsible for enforcing time limits,\nmaintaining records, and ensuring that trades with multiple responding\nparticipants are allocated to the provisions in the rules."}

Thanks, Sarah=09\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat =\nNY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20=\n million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 mil=\nlion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line.  (Soc Gen is th=\ne bank that owns Fimat brokerage.)  Fimat made this decision based on the f=\nollowing events according to Steve:\n\nThursday 10/25\nENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from exi=\nsting positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally broker=\ns agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as=\nsociated with the moving of the trades.=20\nSpecifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat=\n agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook =\nthem at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associat=\ned with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send=\n on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade =\nprice, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million=\n on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r=\nate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $=\n10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.   =20\n\nFriday, 10/26\nOn Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When =\nFimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to =\nsend the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on=\n behalf of Enron. =20\nOn Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 =\nmillion by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G=\nen margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fima=\nt wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat.=\n=20\nOn Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  F=\nimat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The numbe=\nr of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer=\ne undisclosed. =20\nVery late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can=\nada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada. =20\nBased in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r=\night now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer. =20\nFimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou=\nses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable=\n with these events. =20\n\nMonday, 10/29\nFimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess =\nthe brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer=\nred to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that =\nit would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would n=\not confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later =\nin the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by=\n 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agre=\nement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should mov=\ne so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di=\nscomfort with ENE as a counter party. =20\n\nTuesday, 10/30\n100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.\n\nFimat proposed solutions\n$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf\nGuarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has alrea=\ndy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)\nENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen=\nts on ENE's behalf\n\nMy tkae on the situation:\nFimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad =\npress.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim=\nat was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m=\nargin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of=\n the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was=\n responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepar=\ned neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak=\ne payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved wh=\nen the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi=\nne so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the disc=\nussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Fin=\nally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no=\ntice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think=\n we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on =\nan on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week=\n but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea=\nrly in the morning like all the other brokers. =20\n\nWe need to determine how much we need Fimat right now.  I am not inclined t=\no entirely blow them off especially sinces I  do not want them to tell othe=\nr brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ=\nt now.  At the same time, no one around Enron needs more work right now and=\n we can not hold a high maintenance broker's hand hand every step of the wa=\ny.  Let's decide what to do and implement.\n\nSarah\n\n"}

{"text": "\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tExchange Information <Marketing@NYMEX.com>@ENRON  \nSent:\tFriday, November 30, 2001 8:31 AM\nTo:\tExchange Information\nSubject:\t(01-411) NEW NYMEX LARGE ORDER EXECUTION RULE FOR NATURAL GAS FUT\tURES\n\nNovember 30, 2001\nNotice No. 01-411\n\nTO:\t\tNYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS\n\t\tNYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS\n\nFROM:\t\tJ. Robert Collins, Jr., President\n\nSUBJECT:\tNEW NYMEX LARGE ORDER EXECUTION RULE FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES\n____________________________________________________________________________\n_____\n\nYesterday, the Exchange distributed Notice to Members No. 01-411, which\nsummarized a new large order execution (LOX) that begins today in the first\ntwo months of the natural gas futures contract.  As an informational\nfollow-up to yesterday's notice, this notice includes the text of the new\nLOX rule.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEW NYMEX RULE 6.58\n\nRule 6.58.\tLARGE LOT TRADING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS (PILOT PROGAM)\n\nA Floor Member may buy or sell a large lot quantity of futures contracts at\nor above the minimum amount specified below at a single price on an all or\nnone basis, provided that each such transaction is conducted on the Exchange\ntrading floor in accordance with the large order execution (\"LOX\")\nprocedures specified in this rule.\n\n(A) Eligible Futures Contract and Minimum LOX Transaction Size.  LOX\ntransactions may be effected only for transactions in the following NYMEX\nDivision futures contracts and for no less than the following minimum LOX\ntransaction quantities:\n\n\t\t\tFutures Contract \t\tContract Months\nMinimum LOX Transaction Size\n\n\t\t\tNatural Gas\t\t\t1st and 2nd nearby\n250\n\t(Six-Month Pilot Program)\n\n(B) Eligible Orders.  A member may not execute any order by means of a LOX\ntransaction unless the LOX bid or Offer price is the best price available to\nsatisfy the terms of the order or unless the order includes specific\ninstructions to execute a LOX transaction.\n\n(C) Request for Quote.  To make a request for quote (RFQ) for a LOX\ntransaction, an initiating Floor Member (Initiating Member) will announce an\ninterest in executing a LOX transaction either by requesting a LOX Bid or\nOffer or both, from a specified location in the ring.  In addition, the\nInitiating Member must specify to the ring the total quantity and contract\nmonth of the RFQ.  All terms of the RFQ including the identity of the\nInitiating Member will be recorded by the LOX Book Holder (LBH).  In any\ncase that a LOX RFQ results in a response deemed by the LBH to be\nreasonable, the Initiating Member will incur RFQ fees, regardless of whether\nor not that Floor Member executes a trade.\n\nThere shall be only one active RFQ for a contract month at a time.\n\nThe maximum quantity allowed for a LOX RFQ is 5,000 contracts.\n\n(D) Bids and Offers in Response to a LOX RFQ. Any Floor Member that has bid\nand/or offered the best price in response to the LOX RFQ for the full\nquantity stated in the LOX RFQ and has been recognized by the LBH as making\na reasonable bid or offer will be the Initial Respondent.  Any Floor Member\nresponding to a LOX RFQ must indicate that the responding LOX bid or LOX\noffer is in response to such RFQ (LOX Bid or Offer).  Once a LOX Bid and/or\nOffer has been made and deemed by the LBH to be an acceptable bid and/or\noffer, such bid or offer will be recorded by the LBH and will be active for\n30 seconds from the time it has been recognized by the LBH or until it has\nbeen expressly withdrawn, with acknowledgement from the LBH, by the Floor\nMember making such bid or offer.  All LOX bids and offers must be quoted in\nhalf cent or full cent increments.\n\n(1) LOX Bids and Offers Outside Non-LOX Spread. A LOX Bid (Offer) may be at\nor above (below) the instant bid (offer) for non-LOX trading being bid or\noffered in the ring for that futures contract month.\n\n(2) Aggregation of Orders by Brokers. Floor Members acting as brokers may\nbundle limit orders to bid and/or offer in response to the LOX RFQ.  If the\ntotal of the orders is less than the requested amount, the responding broker\ncan trade for his own account or an account which he controls, the\ndifference between the requested amount and the total of the orders.  In the\nevent that a broker bundles limit orders in connection with a LOX execution,\nall bundled limited orders must receive the LOX execution price.\n\n(3) Aggregation by Floor Members Trading for Proprietary Accounts.  In\nresponse to a LOX RFQ, Floor Members trading for their proprietary accounts\nmay join together in bidding and/or offering for the full quantity of the\nLOX RFQ.  Such proprietary accounts either may be a personal account in the\ncase of an individual member or a house proprietary account in the case of a\nMember Firm or Clearing Member with a representative on the Trading Floor.\n\n(4) Secondary Trading Right for Proprietary Accounts.  In response to a LOX\nRFQ, only a Floor Member trading for his proprietary account, or for\nproprietary accounts joined together as per section (D)(3) of this rule, may\nbid and/or offer for a portion of the LOX RFQ, provided, however, that such\nquantity bid and/or offered must be for an amount no less than the Minimum\nLOX Transaction Size and that such bid and/or offer can only be submitted if\nan Initial Respondent has been identified by the LBH and that Initial\nRespondent is a Floor Member acting as a broker.  This right will be known\nas a Secondary Trading Right.\n\nIn order to exercise the Secondary Trading Right, each Member must state\nhis/her intentions to the LBH.  For purposes of the Secondary Trading Right,\nFloor Members trading for their proprietary trading accounts may exercise\nthis right by joining a bid or offer at any time prior to execution of the\nLOX transaction and will be entitled to an aggregate amount of up to 50% of\nthe quantity stated in the RFQ.\n\nWhen a Floor Member combines customer orders with proprietary business and\nis recognized as the Initial Respondent, any reduction in the ultimate\nallocation that results from an exercise of a Secondary Trading Right will\nresult in fills first allocated to the customer(s) with any remainder to the\nFloor Member.  In addition, if, as the result of such an exercise, a broker\ndoes not have a quantity sufficient to fill each of the orders that were\naggregated, the broker shall allocate fills according to the following\nrequirements:\n\na)\tthe fills shall be allocated pursuant to a predetermined allocation\nmethodology made available to the customers prior to the execution;\nb)\tthe allocation shall be made as soon as practicable after the\ntransaction is executed;\nc)\tthe allocation shall be fair and equitable and no account or group\nof accounts may receive consistently favorable or unfavorable treatment;\nd)\tthe allocation methodology shall be sufficiently objective and\nspecific so that it can verified for any given trade; and\ne)\tthe allocation methodology must be consistently applied.\n\nFloor Members may not exercise a Secondary Trading Right if such Floor\nMember is the Initial Respondent acting as a broker.\n\n\n(5) Trading Priority.  Any Floor Member who becomes the Initial Respondent\nwilling to trade the full quantity stated in the LOX RFQ at the ultimate\nbest bid and, or best offer will have a right of trading priority which will\nentitle him to the full quantity stated in the RFQ, except in the case when\na Secondary Trading Right is exercised.\n\n\n(E) LOX Execution.\n1.  Time Limit Restriction. Once an Initial Respondent has been recognized\nby the LBH, only the Initiating Member requesting the LOX RFQ, may hit such\nLOX Bid or Offer (or both) and must do so within 30 seconds of LBH\nrecognition of the Initial Respondent subject to the following conditions:\n\n2.\tExercise of Secondary Trading Rights.   If one or more Floor Members\nexercises the Secondary Trading Rights provided by this rule, the LBH will\nenforce such rights in the following manner:\n\nEach Floor Member responding to the LOX RFQ (either as an Initial Respondent\nor in exercise of a Secondary Trading Right) shall receive an allocation\nequal to a weighted proportion based on the number of contracts bid or\noffered by such Member as a percentage of the total quantity of all\ncontracts bid or offered in response to the LOX RFQ, as the case may be, at\nthe price accepted by the Initiating Member, provided,  however,\n\nIf, as a result of the allocation specified above, an Initial Respondent\nacting as a broker would receive less than 50% of the total quantity, then\nthe LBH instead shall allocate no less than 50% of the total quantity to\nsuch Initial Respondent with the remainder allocated to those exercising\ntheir Secondary Trading Rights based on  the number of contracts bid or\noffered by each such Floor Member as a percentage of all contracts bid or\noffered pursuant to the exercise of Secondary Trading Rights.\n\nFollowing execution of the LOX transaction, the LBH will confirm the parties\nto the transaction and the quantity allocated to each respondent.\n\n(F) Responsibility for LOX Orders.  A Floor Member shall not be liable for\nfailure to execute an order as a LOX order unless such order was designated\nby the customer as a LOX order.\n\n(G) Impact on Non-LOX Orders.  In no event shall a LOX order elect stop\nloss, market-if-touched or other contingency orders, or otherwise affect\norders in the regular non-LOX market.\n\n(H) Closing Period and Post-Close Prohibition.  LOX transactions will\nneither be allowed during the closing period nor during the post-close\nsession for applicable contracts.\n"}

Robert Collins, Jr., President\n\nSUBJECT:\tCORRECTION: REMINDER ON EFS REQUIREMENTS FOR NATURAL GAS\nFUTURES\n____________________________________________________________________________\n_____\n\nPreviously, in Notice to Members #01-366, the Exchange announced a new\nprogram that commenced on November 1, 2001 and that permits the exchange of\nswaps for futures in Natural Gas futures contracts.  As an informational\nfollow-up to that notice, this notice includes the text of this EFS rule.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.21A\n\n(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)\n\n Rule 6.21A.  EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP\nTRANSACTIONS  (Pilot Program)\n\n(A) (1) An exchange of futures for, or in connection with, a swap (EFS)\nconsists of two discrete, but related, transactions; a swap transaction and\na futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is effected, the buyer\nand seller of the futures must be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of\nthe swap.  The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the\nfutures contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such\ncommodity).  The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately\nequivalent to the quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap\ncomponent of an EFS transaction must comply with the applicable CFTC swap\nregulatory requirements.  The initial term of the pilot program shall be\nthree years from the effective date of this Rule 6.21A.\n\n\t(2) Eligible Contracts and Transactions.  EFS transactions may be\neffected only for transactions in the Exchange's Brent crude oil futures\ncontract  * or in the Henry Hub Natural Gas futures contract (for a period\nof six months following implementation of the pilot program for Natural Gas\nEFS transactions) * .\n\n(B)(1)  The report of an EFS transaction shall be given on the Floor of the\nExchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) EFS transactions *\ninvolving the Brent contract * are permitted until the close of trading on\nthe last trading day in the expiring contract month [of the applicable\ncontract(s)].  * (3) EFS transactions involving Natural Gas contract are\npermitted until two hours after trading terminates on the last day of\ntrading in the expiring contract month. *\n\n(C)  A report of such EFS transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by\neach Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such report\nshall identify the EFS as made under this Rule and shall contain the\nfollowing information: a statement that the swap component of the EFS\ncomplied with the applicable CFTC swap regulatory requirements at the time\nthe EFS was entered into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the\nEFS has resulted or will result in a change of payments or other such\nchange, the kind and quantity of the futures, the price at which the futures\ntransaction is to be cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and\ncustomers and such other information as the Exchange may require.  Such\nreport (form) shall be submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon,\nno later than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the\nEFS on the Floor of the Exchange.\n\n(D)(1) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that\nthe transaction is a legitimate EFS transaction.  Upon the request of the\nExchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EFS, including a master\nswap agreement and any supplements thereto, shall be obtained by the\nClearing Members from the buyer or seller and made available by the Clearing\nMembers for examination by the Exchange.  Additionally, if the buyer or\nseller is a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may obtain the information\ndirectly from such person(s).\n\n(2) For [all NYMEX Division contracts] * the Brent contract *, no EFS that\nis linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting swap\ntransaction may be transacted during Regular Trading Hours at any time that\nNYMEX offers trading in its contracts, unless trading in a market is halted,\nsuch as during a physical emergency.   * For the Natural Gas contract, no\nEFS that is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting\nswap transaction may be transacted at any time. *\n\n(3)\tFailure by a buyer or seller, or its Clearing Member to satisfy the\nExchange that an EFS transaction is bona fide shall subject such buyer or\nseller, if a Member/Member Firm, or the Clearing Member to disciplinary\naction.  Such disciplinary action, depending on the gravity of the offense,\nmay be deemed to be a major offense of the Exchange's rules.  Further, if\nthe buyer or seller is not a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may conduct a\nhearing before the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition or deny\naccess to the market.\n\n(E) Each EFS transaction shall be posted by the Floor Members and cleared\nthrough the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures and by the\nClearing Members involved.\n\n(F)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EFS\nreporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange's\nCompliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus\naccount or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another\nomnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EFS pursuant\nto Rule 6.21A(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other\ninformation as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be\nsubmitted to the Exchange's Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later\nthan two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the\nFloor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to\nsubmit either the agreement or the particular EFS information to the\nExchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,\ncondition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the\nmarket."}

{"text": "\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tExchange Information <Marketing@NYMEX.com>@ENRON  \nSent:\tWednesday, October 31, 2001 2:34 PM\nTo:\tExchange Information\nSubject:\t(01-366) Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas\n\nNotice # 01-366\nOctober 31, 2001\n\nTO:\nAll NYMEX Division members\nAll NYMEX Division cleating members\n\nFROM:\nJ. Robert Collins, Jr., President\n\nRE:\nIntroduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas\n\n\n\nThe New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow\nexchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its\nplans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural\ngas market.\n\nThis plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the\nnatural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas\nswaps and basis contracts.\n\nWe are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this\ninstrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to\nreinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our\nmarket, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars\navailable to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each\nguarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique\nposition to offer these services.\n\nIn addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the\nequivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the\nnotional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3\ntrillion, or $14 billion per day.\n\nEFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical\n(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the\nexecution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures\ntransaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The\ntransaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market\nquantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities\nand will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the\nunderlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to\nliquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two\nparties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side\nfor each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will\nbe responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures\ncontracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be\ncleared, and the identity of the parties involved.\n\nForward Looking and Cautionary Statements\nThe New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to\nmake statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using\nwords such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar\nsubstance in connection with any discussion of its present and future\noperations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or\non behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,\nand other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,\nincluding; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange\npartners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

{"text": "EDF is concerned because they are worried about the number of positions they are taking on for Enron.  They want to make an additional margin call of $45 million which ENE is not willing to post (true reason: corporate liquidity issues.) According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis.  EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE.  Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds.  I would not call him up and volunteer to move positions but if he calls you and wants to do so, the moving of positions was agreed to as one way to reduce EDF Man's risk without ENE posting additional cash margin.  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tQuigley, Dutch  \nSent:\tWednesday, October 31, 2001 10:51 AM\nTo:\tWesner-Soong, Sarah\nSubject:\tRE: EDF Man\n\nSarah , \n\nWhat I was remembering was the front months exposures we had at EDF MAN.\n\tPrior to moves                After\nDEC\t-2,003\t\t\t 1,967\nJAN\t10,502\t\t\t-1,588\nFEB\t 1,338\t\t\t   552\nMAR\t-7,013\t\t\t   188\nAPR\t 5,831\t\t\t     33\n\nthe over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.\n\nLet me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.\nWe can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.\n\nDutch\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tWesner-Soong, Sarah  \nSent:\tWednesday, October 31, 2001 10:41 AM\nTo:\tQuigley, Dutch\nSubject:\tEDF Man\n\nDutch - please send me the numbers.

In its first full day, there\nwere 11,100 contracts that changed hands in EFS transactions.\n\nEFS transactions work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP)\ntransactions.  Two parties are allowed to privately negotiate the execution\nof an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on\npricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The transaction must\ninvolve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of\nfutures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and are\npermitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures\ncontract.\n\nEFS transactions are permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures\nmarket positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.  The\nclearing member representing each party is responsible to notify the\nExchange of the amount of futures contracts involved, the price at which the\nfutures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties\ninvolved.\n\nYear-to-date average daily volume in natural gas futures is approximately\n60,000 contracts.

{"text": "Dutch - there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run John's book an=\nd may see something in this situation I do not, I wondered if you could giv=\ne me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner.  Thanks, Sarah=09\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat =\nNY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20=\n million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 mil=\nlion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line.  (Soc Gen is th=\ne bank that owns Fimat brokerage.)  Fimat made this decision based on the f=\nollowing events according to Steve:\n\nThursday 10/25\nENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from exi=\nsting positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally broker=\ns agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as=\nsociated with the moving of the trades.=20\nSpecifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat=\n agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook =\nthem at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associat=\ned with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send=\n on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade =\nprice, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million=\n on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r=\nate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $=\n10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.   =20\n\nFriday, 10/26\nOn Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When =\nFimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to =\nsend the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on=\n behalf of Enron. =20\nOn Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 =\nmillion by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G=\nen margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fima=\nt wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat.=\n=20\nOn Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  F=\nimat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The numbe=\nr of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer=\ne undisclosed. =20\nVery late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can=\nada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada. =20\nBased in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r=\night now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer. =20\nFimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou=\nses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable=\n with these events. =20\n\nMonday, 10/29\nFimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess =\nthe brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer=\nred to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that =\nit would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would n=\not confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later =\nin the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by=\n 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agre=\nement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should mov=\ne so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di=\nscomfort with ENE as a counter party. =20\n\nTuesday, 10/30\n100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.\n\nFimat proposed solutions\n$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf\nGuarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has alrea=\ndy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)\nENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen=\nts on ENE's behalf\n\nMy tkae on the situation:\nFimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad =\npress.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim=\nat was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m=\nargin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of=\n the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was=\n responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepar=\ned neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak=\ne payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved wh=\nen the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi=\nne so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the disc=\nussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Fin=\nally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no=\ntice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think=\n we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on =\nan on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week=\n but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea=\nrly in the morning like all the other brokers. =20\n\nWe need to determine how much we need Fimat right now.  I am not inclined t=\no entirely blow them off especially sinces I  do not want them to tell othe=\nr brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ=\nt now.  At the same time, no one around Enron needs more work right now and=\n we can not hold a high maintenance broker's hand hand every step of the wa=\ny.  Let's decide what to do and implement.\n\nSarah\n\n"}

{"text": "One of the reasons I asked about traders' reluctance to deal with Enron is the article below questions our ability to deliver on winter gas.  I would like to prepare an answer in case anyone asks.  \n\n\nPOWER POINTS: Time For A Bronx Miracle In Houston\nBy Mark Golden\n\n11/02/2001\nDow Jones Energy Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nA Dow Jones Newswires Column \n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by two runs with one man on, Enron Corp. (ENE) needs nothing less than a home run just to stay in the game.\nThis is the home run Enron must come up with: Full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off their balance sheet, and proof the corporation can cover the difference. It's what stockholders, bondholders and trading partners have been demanding, but time is running out, and Enron hasn't produced. \n\"We're going to get to that number soon and tell people. We have to do that,\" said a source at Enron, who didn't know how quickly the disclosure would come or whether it would be independently audited. \"In this environment, we are going to be absolutely sure that it's accurate.\" \nEnron has about $3.3 billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in 2003. The company will sell the assets in those partnerships and, in a worse case scenario, will face a $1 billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets, Enron has said. The company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock, shares will be trading closer to $20 than their current $11. \nInvestors, however, aren't acting as if they're reassured. Part of the trouble, analysts with credit-rating firm Standard & Poor's said Friday morning, is that until Enron sells the assets, nobody knows for sure what they're worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole. \nS&P is confident that Enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole, provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company. \nCredit Derivative Fizzle \n\nTo see the pickle the world's premier energy franchise is in, one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk. That relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely, but the desk hasn't been able to transact for three weeks, since the value of Enron's stock and bonds began to plummet, according to another Enron employee. \nEnron didn't respond to a request for comment, but the Enron Credit division in Europe said in a release that lines are \"constrained\" as the market continues to evaluate the company's credit position. \nUntil recently, customers would buy a credit derivative from Enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company. A big supplier to a financially troubled company like Xerox Corp. (XRX) or Lucent Technologies (LU), for example, might pay Enron $1 million a year for a payout of, say, $10 million in the event of a bankruptcy. \nBut you wouldn't pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims. Likewise, with Enron's creditworthiness in doubt, there's no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange Lucent risk for Enron risk. \nThe same holds true, though less obviously, for Enron's core business of energy trading. Some utilities, large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices - already on the rise at $3 per million British thermal units - shoot to $10 this winter as they did last winter. \nTo guard against that risk, companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices. If a company wants to lock in winter gas at $3, should it turn to Enron? If gas were to rise to $10 in January and Enron couldn't deliver, Enron's counterparty paid a good price for no protection. And if Enron failed in a $10 gas market, that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies. Gas could go to $20 in a heartbeat. \nLeading Role An Asset \n\nEnron does have a man on base. The company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want Enron to survive. And any company that moves to lock Enron out of the market now could regret doing so if Enron survives as the big dog. \nEnron's trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point: They are continuing to trade with Enron, but are avoiding long-term deals that increase their exposure to the company. The only acceptable long-term deals are those that offset deals done earlier. Unless and until a bill goes unpaid, they'll keep delivering. \nEnron, like the rest of the U.S. energy industry, paid its bills for September gas deliveries on Oct. 20 and for its September electricity deliveries on Oct. 25. Its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of November. \nThat means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before Enron's creditworthiness faces another test. In exchange for taking on that small risk, they keep the great market maker in business. \nLenders Show Concerns \n\nLenders, whether through holding Enron bonds or providing loans, don't have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash. Lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time, usually years. \nOutside of long-term commitments, what worries the banks, which presumably got a good look at Enron's books? If Enron is now unable to make the big bets with long-term energy deals that have kept it profitable for years, can it service all of its liabilities, known and unknown? If it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants, or otherwise put those assets at risk, will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs? What happens if its greatest asset - its traders - leave in droves to work elsewhere? \nIf Enron is to have a chance, it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt. So far this year, trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for $2.2 billion out of $2.4 billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes. By comparison, Enron has made $617 million in interest payments so far this year. \nJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) unit Salomon Smith Barney, at least, don't show much confidence Enron can do it. When they agreed to provide Enron with a $1 billion line of credit, they did so only after Enron posted valuable gas pipelines as collateral. \nBond traders - the most sophisticated investors in the world - make their money by understanding the probabilities. They're trading Enron debt at levels typically associated with distressed companies. \nThe lenders have chalked up their runs. Shareholders have ratcheted up the pressure. \nEnron, now, must step up to the plate. \n-By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com"}

Robert Collins, Jr., President\n\nSUBJECT:\tREMINDER ON EFS REQUIREMENTS FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES\n____________________________________________________________________________\n_____\n\nPreviously, in Notice to Members #01-366, the Exchange announced a new\nprogram that commenced on November 1, 2001 and that permits the exchange of\nswaps for futures in Natural Gas futures contracts.  As an informational\nfollow-up to yesterday's notice, this notice includes the text of the new\nLOX rule.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.21A\n\n(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)\n\n Rule 6.21A.  EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP\nTRANSACTIONS  (Pilot Program)\n\n(A) (1) An exchange of futures for, or in connection with, a swap (EFS)\nconsists of two discrete, but related, transactions; a swap transaction and\na futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is effected, the buyer\nand seller of the futures must be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of\nthe swap.  The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the\nfutures contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such\ncommodity).  The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately\nequivalent to the quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap\ncomponent of an EFS transaction must comply with the applicable CFTC swap\nregulatory requirements.  The initial term of the pilot program shall be\nthree years from the effective date of this Rule 6.21A.\n\n\t(2) Eligible Contracts and Transactions.  EFS transactions may be\neffected only for transactions in the Exchange's Brent crude oil futures\ncontract  * or in the Henry Hub Natural Gas futures contract (for a period\nof six months following implementation of the pilot program for Natural Gas\nEFS transactions) * .\n\n(B)(1)  The report of an EFS transaction shall be given on the Floor of the\nExchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) EFS transactions *\ninvolving the Brent contract * are permitted until the close of trading on\nthe last trading day in the expiring contract month [of the applicable\ncontract(s)].  * (3) EFS transactions involving Natural Gas contract are\npermitted until two hours after trading terminates on the last day of\ntrading in the expiring contract month. *\n\n(C)  A report of such EFS transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by\neach Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such report\nshall identify the EFS as made under this Rule and shall contain the\nfollowing information: a statement that the swap component of the EFS\ncomplied with the applicable CFTC swap regulatory requirements at the time\nthe EFS was entered into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the\nEFS has resulted or will result in a change of payments or other such\nchange, the kind and quantity of the futures, the price at which the futures\ntransaction is to be cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and\ncustomers and such other information as the Exchange may require.  Such\nreport (form) shall be submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon,\nno later than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the\nEFS on the Floor of the Exchange.\n\n(D)(1) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that\nthe transaction is a legitimate EFS transaction.  Upon the request of the\nExchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EFS, including a master\nswap agreement and any supplements thereto, shall be obtained by the\nClearing Members from the buyer or seller and made available by the Clearing\nMembers for examination by the Exchange.  Additionally, if the buyer or\nseller is a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may obtain the information\ndirectly from such person(s).\n\n(2) For [all NYMEX Division contracts] * the Brent contract *, no EFS that\nis linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting swap\ntransaction may be transacted during Regular Trading Hours at any time that\nNYMEX offers trading in its contracts, unless trading in a market is halted,\nsuch as during a physical emergency.   * For the Natural Gas contract, no\nEFS that is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting\nswap transaction may be transacted at any time. *\n\n(3)\tFailure by a buyer or seller, or its Clearing Member to satisfy the\nExchange that an EFS transaction is bona fide shall subject such buyer or\nseller, if a Member/Member Firm, or the Clearing Member to disciplinary\naction.  Such disciplinary action, depending on the gravity of the offense,\nmay be deemed to be a major offense of the Exchange's rules.  Further, if\nthe buyer or seller is not a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may conduct a\nhearing before the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition or deny\naccess to the market.\n\n(E) Each EFS transaction shall be posted by the Floor Members and cleared\nthrough the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures and by the\nClearing Members involved.\n\n(F)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EFS\nreporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange's\nCompliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus\naccount or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another\nomnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EFS pursuant\nto Rule 6.21A(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other\ninformation as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be\nsubmitted to the Exchange's Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later\nthan two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the\nFloor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to\nsubmit either the agreement or the particular EFS information to the\nExchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,\ncondition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the\nmarket."}

{"text": "John,\n\nAs you are aware, there was some confusion on the 2 Peoples trades we did on 10/15/01.  We did not find out there could be a problem until yesterday, 15 days after the trade was input into the system.  I consider this unacceptable so I wanted to find out what happened to our processes internally.  \n\nA person named Richard in the physical confirm area was the one that let Amy know the trade wasn't a financial trade but a physical trade.  I called him to ask him why it took 15 days to find this out.  He said that the deal was entered into as a financial deal so he didn't know about the trade until yesterday.  The person in charge of financial confirms is Diane Anderson and I called her to ask what happened.  She said she didn't know but would check into it.  She left me a message yesterday evening saying that for about 5 days in October they were shorthanded and they didn't confirm any financial trades.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE,  especially in the situation we are currently in.  I haven't talked to her again but I wanted you to know about this.  Not to put any more problems on your desk, but this needs to be fixed.\n\nAmy yesterday found a person at Peoples that knows the trades as we know them (financial).  So the trade is okay, but it could have been a $500,000 hit to Mike's book.\n\nPlease let me know if I can do anything.  Thanks.\n\nJohn\n"}

One number that stood out to us on the ENA PRMA detail was the Q4 2000 settlement of approximately negative $500MM.  We discussed possible reasons for this figure with the ENA accounting group, and they suggested it might be the Dec 2000 Nymex settlement, which was more that negative $600MM.  They suggested that I could contact you for further insight.  Would you have a few minutes sometime today to talk about that settlement?\n\nThanks,\nBen\n5-2047"}

In light of this fact, I have tired not to bother the SME's and provide content for this project via other means. So far so good, but the next step will be for the SME's to review the content for sign-off. Your timely work for review will be invaluable.  \n\nHowever at today's Status meeting Accenture had the following in their status report:\n\n\tIssues for Management Attention\nDutch has not been able to meet with us for the past two weeks, nor has he responded to our e-mail requests for information. This means we are relying on Andy for all the detailed trader content, which includes the two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems. With a maximum of two hours per week with Andy, it has been and will continue to be difficult to get all the help we need. Proposed solution: ask Andy and/or Dutch to give us the name of another trader who can meet with us to answer our detailed questions.\n\n\nMy initial question to you: \"Is this statement accurate?\"\n\nMy next Questions: \"What Can I do to assist you?\"\n\t\t\t \"Can you name someone to provide the information requested (i.e. two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems.)\n\nHere is what I have provided to Accenture to help complete your assignments and to provide content for your review:\n\tBRM Text book\n\tDerivatives I as a resource only\n\tThe slides attached below\n\tOther course work as a resource only\n\nDo you have any suggestions?

{"text": "Good afternoon, everyone.\n\nI have some good news to share with you. There will be no new assignments!\nWe are hoping you will take the time this week to finish up past\nassignments. In addition, we are working on some of your past assignments\nand all future assignments by cutting/pasting from the course material that\nwe have received from Enron HR. We will be asking you to review these\nassignments and update them as necessary. You will still be responsible for\nreviewing and granting final sign-off the topics.\n\nAssignment Status:\nBerney Aucoin:  We are working with Errol McLaughlin from Jeff Gossett's\ngroup to help with the remaining Accounting & Reporting topic assignments.\nWe still need your last three assignments from the Organization Structure\ntopic because current courses we have available to us do not cover this\ncontent. They include write-ups about:\n     Roles and Responsibilities of Mid-Marketers / Origination\n     Roles and Responsibilties of Traders\n     Structure of a Trading Organization\nPlease let us now when you will be able to send these to us. Thanks.\n\nMark Reese: We have been able to find information for the \"Risk Management\"\nportion of your 10/26 assignment and your future assignment. Eventually, we\nwill need you to review what we have put together. In addition, we still\nneed your last four assignments because current courses we have available\nto us do not cover this content in detail. They include write-ups about:\n     Marking to Market, Pricing Models (10/19), Technical Analysis (10/26),\n     Fundamental Analysis (11/2) and VaR (11/9) for the Risk Management\n     Inputs topic\n     Pricing of Hedging Instruments (11/2) (high-level process and\n     discussion about bid/mid/offer) from the Hedging Basics topic\n\nEd McMichael: Thank you for your handing in most of your assignments on\ntime! As we discussed, you accidently left out your write-up on \"Additional\nTypes of Risks\" (11/2) and are going to send that to us this week. You also\nhave the \"Natural Gas Markets\" assignment (11/9) outstanding that the\nResearch group is working on. Please forward us that assignment when you\nrecieve it.  The only assignments that are remaining for your topics are\nabout Crude Oil and Electiricty Markets. We are working on finding course\nmaterial/resources to help write these. Let us know if you find any leads\nfor these assignments. Moving forward, we will be requesting your review\nand final sign-off on the topic.\n\nDutch Quigley: We are going to cut/paste the information for the Futures\nand Options topics from BRM. I think that Futures will require little time\nfor your review, but we will need you to spend some time reviewing the\nOptions topic and providing examples for both topics. We will be contacting\nyou in the near future to schedule a couple of meetings to review and\nsign-off on this work.\n\nAndy Lewis:  We are going to cut/paste the information for the Forwards and\nOptions topics from BRM. I think that Forwards will require little time for\nyour review, but we will need you to spend some time reviewing the Swaps\ntopic and providing examples for both topics. We will be contacting you in\nthe near future to schedule a couple of meetings to review and sign-off on\nthis work.\n\nThank you and have a good week.\n\nSheri A.

{"text": "Hi Dutch --\n\nSince you offered to answer some of my questions over e-mail, I will take\nyou up on it!    I would still like to get some of your time Monday or\nTuesday to go into more detailed discussion.\n\nQuestion 1:\nWhen we talk about \"the market\" reacting to events, what are the prices\nthat we are talking about? From a simulation standpoint, I am trying to\nfigure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many\nevents.  Is it the forward curve? Is it the spot market price?  Is the\nbid/offer prices for the various instruments? And, if we are having users\ntrade basis, we will need different prices for different locations, right?\n\nQuestion 2:\nGiven that the calculation of VaR is rather involved, we decided that it\nwould not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model.\nHowever, we understand that the user needs to 1) know their VaR and 2) know\nthat they need to make sure they stay within their VaR limit.  So, we will\nneed to set a VaR limit for the user and \"fake\" the individual VaR to\nreflect their risk exposure.\n\nI had a talk with Erro McLaughlin about this.  He made a good point that if\nour user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a VaR is\ncalculated, will they know how to control their VaR, i.e. if a user sees\nthat he is over his VaR limit, what should he do to get it back within the\nlimit.  Is is as simple as not being too long or too short? And if that is\nthe case, would it be sufficient to use position reports/tallies as a proxy\nfor risk exposure, instead of VaR?\n\nOne possible way to fake VaR may be to adjust the VaR number to reflect how\nexposed the user is. So if they are X dollars long, they have a VaR of Y.\nIf they change their position so that they are now 1.5X long, they have a\nVaR of 1.5Y.  Perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account\nmarket volatility.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n\nLastly, when could you meet with me next week? I would really like to meet\non Tuesday, if possible.\n\nThanks so much for your time, Dutch.\n\nHave a terrific weekend!\nAnn\n\n\nThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\nprivileged or confidential information.

In working out the details, we've come across a few\nquestions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's\ndescription of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference.\n\n1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.  We\nunderstand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging\nfuture months, they need to take time value of money into account.  What is\nactually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments?\nHow does that factor into user's storage decisions?\n\n2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and then\nselect instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our other\nscenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron\nrisk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the\nappropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments\ncover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by storage\ndecisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in?

Hope you're doing well.\n\n      We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us\n   the\n      framework for.  In working out the details, we've come across a few\n      questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's\n      description of this problem in the word doc below, just for\n   reference.\n\n      1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.\n   We\n      understand that since the users are making storage decisions and\n   hedging\n      future months, they need to take time value of money into account.\n   What\n      is\n      actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the\n   instruments?\n      How does that factor into user's storage decisions?\n\n      2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and\n      then\n      select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our\n      other\n      scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the\n   Enron\n      risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the\n      appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the\n   instruments\n      cover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by\n      storage\n      decisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My\n      thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then\n      would\n      the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks?\n\n      Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!\n\n      Ann\n\n      (See attached file: Storage Problem.doc)\n\n\n      This message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\n      privileged, proprietary, or otherwise private information.

Robert Collins, Jr., President\n\nRE:\nIntroduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas\n\n\n\nThe New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow\nexchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its\nplans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural\ngas market.\n\nThis plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the\nnatural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas\nswaps and basis contracts.\n\nWe are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this\ninstrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to\nreinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our\nmarket, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars\navailable to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each\nguarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique\nposition to offer these services.\n\nIn addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the\nequivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the\nnotional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3\ntrillion, or $14 billion per day.\n\nEFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical\n(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the\nexecution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures\ntransaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The\ntransaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market\nquantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities\nand will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the\nunderlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to\nliquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two\nparties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side\nfor each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will\nbe responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures\ncontracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be\ncleared, and the identity of the parties involved.\n\nForward Looking and Cautionary Statements\nThe New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to\nmake statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using\nwords such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar\nsubstance in connection with any discussion of its present and future\noperations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or\non behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,\nand other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,\nincluding; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange\npartners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

{"text": "EDF is concerned because they are worried about the number of positions they are taking on for Enron.  They want to make an additional margin call of $45 million which ENE is not willing to post (true reason: corporate liquidity issues.) According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis.  EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE.  Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds.

{"text": "Dutch - there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run John's book an=\nd may see something in this situation I do not, I wondered if you could giv=\ne me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner.  Thanks, Sarah=09\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat =\nNY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20=\n million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 mil=\nlion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line.  (Soc Gen is th=\ne bank that owns Fimat brokerage.)  Fimat made this decision based on the f=\nollowing events according to Steve:\n\nThursday 10/25\nENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from exi=\nsting positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally broker=\ns agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as=\nsociated with the moving of the trades.=20\nSpecifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat=\n agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook =\nthem at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associat=\ned with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send=\n on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade =\nprice, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million=\n on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r=\nate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $=\n10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.   =20\n\nFriday, 10/26\nOn Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When =\nFimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to =\nsend the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on=\n behalf of Enron. =20\nOn Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 =\nmillion by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G=\nen margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fima=\nt wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat.=\n=20\nOn Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  F=\nimat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The numbe=\nr of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer=\ne undisclosed. =20\nVery late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can=\nada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada. =20\nBased in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r=\night now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer. =20\nFimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou=\nses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable=\n with these events. =20\n\nMonday, 10/29\nFimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess =\nthe brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer=\nred to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that =\nit would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would n=\not confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later =\nin the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by=\n 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agre=\nement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should mov=\ne so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di=\nscomfort with ENE as a counter party. =20\n\nTuesday, 10/30\n100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.\n\nFimat proposed solutions\n$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf\nGuarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has alrea=\ndy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)\nENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen=\nts on ENE's behalf\n\nMy tkae on the situation:\nFimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad =\npress.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim=\nat was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m=\nargin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of=\n the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was=\n responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepar=\ned neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak=\ne payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved wh=\nen the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi=\nne so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the disc=\nussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Fin=\nally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no=\ntice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think=\n we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on =\nan on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week=\n but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea=\nrly in the morning like all the other brokers. =20\n\nWe need to determine how much we need Fimat right now.  I am not inclined t=\no entirely blow them off especially sinces I  do not want them to tell othe=\nr brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ=\nt now.  At the same time, no one around Enron needs more work right now and=\n we can not hold a high maintenance broker's hand hand every step of the wa=\ny.  Let's decide what to do and implement.\n\nSarah\n\n"}

{"text": "One of the reasons I asked about traders' reluctance to deal with Enron is the article below questions our ability to deliver on winter gas.  I would like to prepare an answer in case anyone asks.  \n\n\nPOWER POINTS: Time For A Bronx Miracle In Houston\nBy Mark Golden\n\n11/02/2001\nDow Jones Energy Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nA Dow Jones Newswires Column \n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by two runs with one man on, Enron Corp. (ENE) needs nothing less than a home run just to stay in the game.\nThis is the home run Enron must come up with: Full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off their balance sheet, and proof the corporation can cover the difference. It's what stockholders, bondholders and trading partners have been demanding, but time is running out, and Enron hasn't produced. \n\"We're going to get to that number soon and tell people. We have to do that,\" said a source at Enron, who didn't know how quickly the disclosure would come or whether it would be independently audited. \"In this environment, we are going to be absolutely sure that it's accurate.\" \nEnron has about $3.3 billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in 2003. The company will sell the assets in those partnerships and, in a worse case scenario, will face a $1 billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets, Enron has said. The company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock, shares will be trading closer to $20 than their current $11. \nInvestors, however, aren't acting as if they're reassured. Part of the trouble, analysts with credit-rating firm Standard & Poor's said Friday morning, is that until Enron sells the assets, nobody knows for sure what they're worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole. \nS&P is confident that Enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole, provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company. \nCredit Derivative Fizzle \n\nTo see the pickle the world's premier energy franchise is in, one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk. That relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely, but the desk hasn't been able to transact for three weeks, since the value of Enron's stock and bonds began to plummet, according to another Enron employee. \nEnron didn't respond to a request for comment, but the Enron Credit division in Europe said in a release that lines are \"constrained\" as the market continues to evaluate the company's credit position. \nUntil recently, customers would buy a credit derivative from Enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company. A big supplier to a financially troubled company like Xerox Corp. (XRX) or Lucent Technologies (LU), for example, might pay Enron $1 million a year for a payout of, say, $10 million in the event of a bankruptcy. \nBut you wouldn't pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims. Likewise, with Enron's creditworthiness in doubt, there's no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange Lucent risk for Enron risk. \nThe same holds true, though less obviously, for Enron's core business of energy trading. Some utilities, large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices - already on the rise at $3 per million British thermal units - shoot to $10 this winter as they did last winter. \nTo guard against that risk, companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices. If a company wants to lock in winter gas at $3, should it turn to Enron? If gas were to rise to $10 in January and Enron couldn't deliver, Enron's counterparty paid a good price for no protection. And if Enron failed in a $10 gas market, that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies. Gas could go to $20 in a heartbeat. \nLeading Role An Asset \n\nEnron does have a man on base. The company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want Enron to survive. And any company that moves to lock Enron out of the market now could regret doing so if Enron survives as the big dog. \nEnron's trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point: They are continuing to trade with Enron, but are avoiding long-term deals that increase their exposure to the company. The only acceptable long-term deals are those that offset deals done earlier. Unless and until a bill goes unpaid, they'll keep delivering. \nEnron, like the rest of the U.S. energy industry, paid its bills for September gas deliveries on Oct. 20 and for its September electricity deliveries on Oct. 25. Its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of November. \nThat means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before Enron's creditworthiness faces another test. In exchange for taking on that small risk, they keep the great market maker in business. \nLenders Show Concerns \n\nLenders, whether through holding Enron bonds or providing loans, don't have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash. Lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time, usually years. \nOutside of long-term commitments, what worries the banks, which presumably got a good look at Enron's books? If Enron is now unable to make the big bets with long-term energy deals that have kept it profitable for years, can it service all of its liabilities, known and unknown? If it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants, or otherwise put those assets at risk, will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs? What happens if its greatest asset - its traders - leave in droves to work elsewhere? \nIf Enron is to have a chance, it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt. So far this year, trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for $2.2 billion out of $2.4 billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes. By comparison, Enron has made $617 million in interest payments so far this year. \nJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) unit Salomon Smith Barney, at least, don't show much confidence Enron can do it. When they agreed to provide Enron with a $1 billion line of credit, they did so only after Enron posted valuable gas pipelines as collateral. \nBond traders - the most sophisticated investors in the world - make their money by understanding the probabilities. They're trading Enron debt at levels typically associated with distressed companies. \nThe lenders have chalked up their runs. Shareholders have ratcheted up the pressure. \nEnron, now, must step up to the plate. \n-By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com"}

In its first full day, there\nwere 11,100 contracts that changed hands in EFS transactions.\n\nEFS transactions work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP)\ntransactions.  Two parties are allowed to privately negotiate the execution\nof an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on\npricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The transaction must\ninvolve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of\nfutures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and are\npermitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures\ncontract.\n\nEFS transactions are permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures\nmarket positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.  The\nclearing member representing each party is responsible to notify the\nExchange of the amount of futures contracts involved, the price at which the\nfutures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties\ninvolved.\n\nYear-to-date average daily volume in natural gas futures is approximately\n60,000 contracts.  Yesterday's volume, including the EFS transactions was\n73,364 natural gas futures contracts."}

Thanks, Sarah=09\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat =\nNY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20=\n million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 mil=\nlion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line.  (Soc Gen is th=\ne bank that owns Fimat brokerage.)  Fimat made this decision based on the f=\nollowing events according to Steve:\n\nThursday 10/25\nENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from exi=\nsting positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally broker=\ns agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as=\nsociated with the moving of the trades.=20\nSpecifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat=\n agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook =\nthem at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associat=\ned with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send=\n on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade =\nprice, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million=\n on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r=\nate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $=\n10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.   =20\n\nFriday, 10/26\nOn Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When =\nFimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to =\nsend the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on=\n behalf of Enron. =20\nOn Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 =\nmillion by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G=\nen margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fima=\nt wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat.=\n=20\nOn Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  F=\nimat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The numbe=\nr of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer=\ne undisclosed. =20\nVery late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can=\nada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada. =20\nBased in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r=\night now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer. =20\nFimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou=\nses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable=\n with these events. =20\n\nMonday, 10/29\nFimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess =\nthe brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer=\nred to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that =\nit would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would n=\not confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later =\nin the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by=\n 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agre=\nement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should mov=\ne so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di=\nscomfort with ENE as a counter party. =20\n\nTuesday, 10/30\n100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.\n\nFimat proposed solutions\n$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf\nGuarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has alrea=\ndy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)\nENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen=\nts on ENE's behalf\n\nMy tkae on the situation:\nFimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad =\npress.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim=\nat was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m=\nargin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of=\n the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was=\n responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepar=\ned neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak=\ne payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved wh=\nen the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi=\nne so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the disc=\nussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Fin=\nally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no=\ntice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think=\n we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on =\nan on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week=\n but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea=\nrly in the morning like all the other brokers. =20\n\nWe need to determine how much we need Fimat right now.  I am not inclined t=\no entirely blow them off especially sinces I  do not want them to tell othe=\nr brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ=\nt now.  At the same time, no one around Enron needs more work right now and=\n we can not hold a high maintenance broker's hand hand every step of the wa=\ny.  Let's decide what to do and implement.\n\nSarah\n\n"}

Amanda has been home sick the past two days and i have been rescheduling appts and putting away christmas decorations. she is doing better and will head to school tomorrow.   \nDenise i hope you are taking care of yourself. \nKay and Dutch - thanks for sending your address, the kids are in the process of writing holiday thank you's.  Any chance you could send or email a picture of the puppy Rex, they would love it and me too. \nKevin and Jo came for dinner last friday and kevin loaded some cool picture scanning software - hopefully i'll get some photos out this year on the web. \nLife is going good here - i am going to the  annual mardi gras committee meetings and setting boundaries and have NOT volunteered to head a committee. I just answer questions and give details and just talk to people about details.  I am loving IT!! and not overwhelmed. My big decision will be what dress to wear.  Larry is right back into working HARD on these sprint deals after our ski trip.  The kids are asking to go again - even Kyle after altitude sickness- they both want to be in breckenridge!! Larry talked to a friend that has a condo in i think winter park. said we could use it sometime.  any other news:  Kyle was star student last week - made a huge poster with tons of pictures to share with his class.  Amazing to me that he is almost 7 years old.  The art teacher told me that after class last monday he just spontaneously gave her the biggest hug  and it made her day.  He is one special little boy.   \nHugs and love to each of you, \nMichele \nPS Hey mom thought you'd enjoy reading this too.  "}

His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is uncle=\nar.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed =\nfor only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried =\nthe ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy=\n of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to! s! ee some=\n work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Countryman =\nUpdated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Den=\nver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is=\n getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI =\n- She Said Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was i=\nntercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer,=\n who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Ca=\nli Bound Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 r=\nushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unles=\ns your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Pumpdog Updated 11=\n/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If=\n you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular =\nlooks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/1=\n8/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes fo=\nr 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third =\ndowns and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backu=\np for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman =\nUpdated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but=\n he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for con=\nsistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosi=\nve, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Baby Blues Updated =\n11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he fa=\niled to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch=\n unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Cali B=\nound Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. Th=\ne rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams. =\n Marty Booker , WR CHI - Xtreme Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes=\n for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has =\nbecome a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, =\nno matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Up=\ndated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The s=\necond-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy playe=\nr.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated! 1! 1/18/01 Tomlinso=\nn put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a tou=\nchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, whi=\nch may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire p=\nreseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - She Said Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nin=\ne passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While he doesn't scor=\ne often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, an=\nd he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillro=\nds Updated 11/18! /0!  Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland,=\n throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, star=\nting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Xtre=\nme Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at =\nPittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owne=\nrs this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/18/0=\n1 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and f=\nour touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league=\n and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - Third World Countr=\nyman Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes=\n for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an e=\nvery-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up hug=\ne Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free A=\ngent Updated 11/18/01 Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter =\nof Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graha=\nm.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Cali Bound Updated 11/18/01 Favre threw for 262 y=\nards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times an=\nd lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's po=\ntential for big games makes him a must-start every week.  Corey Bradford , =\nWR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Bradford caught three passes for 117 ya=\nrds against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be =\nconsidered a solid Fantasy player.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - The Wounded D=\nucks Updated 11/18/01 Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yard=\ns, two TDs and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when hea=\nlthy.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Christian rushe=\nd for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcon=\ns are using him more often, and Christian makes a go! od! backup RB right n=\now.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/18/01 Grbac thr=\new for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The=\n veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should not start fo=\nr most Fantasy teams.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated =\n11/18/01 Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The=\n rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give y=\nou some occasional TDs down the stretch.   Tim Couch , QB CLE - Pierres Fle=\na Circus Updated 11/18/01 Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepte=\nd three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a=\n Fantasy backup right now.  Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/1=\n8/01 Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 t=\nimes for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and later=\nal quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB=\n.   James Jackson , RB CLE - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/18/01 Jackson =\n(ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carr=\nies in his place.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Xtreme Updated 11/18/01 Smith ru=\nshed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith appears to be =\nmired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless you lack dept=\nh at RB.  Chris Chambers , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01!  The rooki=\ne wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets. Chambers is=\n still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

Line=\nbacker Mike Barrow has a hip pointer, but should be able to play in the gam=\ne as well with some extra padding. CB Will Allen has a sprained ankle, and =\nhis status against the Eagles is questionable at this point.   Ryan Leaf , =\nQB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dal! la! s Morning News , Leaf wi=\nll get his chance to win the starting QB job in the next few weeks. \"If we'=\nre going to get an evaluation on him, this is the open window,\" coach Dave =\nCampo said. \"At this point, I don't know if he's going to be any more than =\nthe third quarterback, but this is the window of opportunity.\" In any event=\n, Leaf's value as a Fantasy player will be very minimal.   Joey Galloway , =\nWR DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off=\n from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Mo=\nnday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be=\n determined.   Reggie Swinton , WR DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Swinton (hamstring=\n) will not practice this week in order to rest his injury. He will be re-ev=\naluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against =\nArizona will be determined.   Robert Thomas , RB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Thom=\nas had an MRI performed on his sprained left ankle Monday, and is expected =\nto miss at least one game. Thomas has no real Fantasy value at this point. =\n  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA  Updated 10/16/01 Hasselbeck is scheduled to sta=\nrt the Seahawks' next game October 28 against Miami due to a ! gr! oin inju=\nry suffered by Trent Dilfer on Sunday. \"Matt has had a couple of weeks to w=\natch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove,\" Head Coa=\nch Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Ha=\nsselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially against the Dolphins' d=\nefense in Week Seven.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA  Updated 10/16/01 Dilfer suffe=\nred a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expec=\nted to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle P=\nost-Intelligencer. \"There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll=\n just leave it at that,\" Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. \"He=\n's injured, and he won't practice this week.\" Dilfer is probably the better=\n Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your te=\nam for the next two weeks.  Tony Richardson  , RB KC  Updated 10/16/01 Chie=\nfs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could p=\nlay Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is bat=\ntling a shoulder injury.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 10/16/01 Wheatl=\ney had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he susta=\nined to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected ba=\nck Tuesday.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA  Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a ! wa! lk=\ning boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the =\nJets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when =\nthe Dolphins return from the bye week.  Brian Griese , QB DEN  Updated 10/1=\n6/01 The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game =\nin San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning =\non his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previ=\nous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as =\nwell as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the star=\nt.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF  Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as proba=\nble for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't be=\nen a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believ=\ne that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Jamal Anderson , RB ATL  =\nUpdated 10/16/01 Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn A=\nCL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured re=\nserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season.   Marshall Faulk , R=\nB STL  Updated 10/16/01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday'! s ! game a=\ngainst the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. \"He really could pos=\nsibly play this week,\" coach Mike Martz said. \"We're not going to rule the =\npossibility of him playing completely out.\" If Faulk is unable to go, howev=\ner, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it=\n's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, =\nso monitor the situation throughout the week.   Justin McCareins , WR TEN  =\nUpdated 10/16/01 McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after break=\ning his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery o=\nn the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback=\n for the rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards.=\n   Eddie Berlin , WR TEN  Updated 10/16/01 Berlin, a rookie receiver used m=\nostly on special teams,  will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered=\n a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sunday.!   Dennis =\nNorthcutt , WR CLE  Updated 10/16/01 Browns' head coach Butch Davis told Th=\ne Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this wee=\nk against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he i=\ns a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week.   Peter Warrick ,=\n WR CIN  Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game a=\ngainst the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.  Marco Bat=\ntaglia , TE CIN  Updated 10/16/01  Battaglia is listed as probable for Sund=\nay's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left shoulder.=\n   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL  Updated 10/16/01 Grbac was feeling woozy and nursi=\nng a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussion he's receive=\nd in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was =\nslammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltim=\nore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback =\nstayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was =\npulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared him=\nself fit enough to play. \"I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking =\nme up! e! very few hours to see if I was alive,\" he said, \"but I'm feeling =\nOK and I'll be ready.\"      Redskins , DT WAS  Updated 10/16/01 Washington =\ncornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game ag=\nainst Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is current=\nly listed as day-to-day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS  Updated 10/16/01 Ale=\nxander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to Washin=\ngton. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-d=\nay.   Duce Staley , RB PHI  Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach And=\ny Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.=\nY. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckha=\nlter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius ,=\n WR NYG  Updated 10/16/01 Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's =\ngame against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so e=\nxpect Jurevicius to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphi=\na.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB  Updated 10/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed He=\nad Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against =\nMinnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made un=\ntil later in the week, but we expect him to go.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL  U=\npdated 10/16/01 Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night=\n's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway s=\nhould have amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's nex=\nt game.    Reggie Swinton , WR DAL  Updated 10/16/01 Swinton suff! er! ed a=\n hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game=\n after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day.   Jackie Harris , =\nTE DAL  Updated 10/16/01 Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night =\nagainst Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real=\n value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL  Updated=\n 10/16/01 Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that att=\naches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss=\n six weeks of action due to the procedure.    Raghib Ismail , WR DAL  Updat=\ned 10/16/01 Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washin=\ngton. He finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of =\nan impact Fantasy-wise.    More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissione=\nr.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Bradford has yet to prove hims=\nelf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Hillrods Updated 10/21=\n/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions=\n was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six gam=\nes this year and has become a m! aj! or scoring threat even though he is no=\nt very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She =\nSaid Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards re=\nceiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most =\npart, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough t=\no bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - She Said Updated 10/21/01 Green threw =\nfor 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been=\n inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod e=\nvery week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman r=\nushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not =\ngreat, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chap=\nman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay hea=\nlthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods Update=\nd 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven recepti=\nons for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers i=\nn the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Michael Pittman , R=\nB ARI - Cali Bound Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday ag=\nainst Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pitt=\nman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valu=\nable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - KMB Express Upd=\nated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven p=\nasses for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable =\nenough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.=\n   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated 10/2! 1/! 01 Tomlinso=\nn was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The=\n rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of=\n the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - The Hill=\nrods Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes f=\nor 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tig=\nht ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly=\n basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Xtreme Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder)=\n st! ar! ted Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He po=\nsted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10=\n loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caug=\nht eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive=\n wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often=\n.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - KMB Express Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dil=\nlon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce bac=\nk from such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Fre=\ne Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against C=\nincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more promi=\nnent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agen=\nt Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati,=\n clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bea=\nrs' featured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The L=\neather Cheerios Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 ! ya! =\nrds and a TD at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he rem=\nains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent a=\nt wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Bat=\nch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Ten=\nnessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he =\nremains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNa=\nir , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD =\nand was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, =\nand many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might =\nbe bothered by shoulder problems.  Eddie George , RB TEN - The Wounded Duck=\ns Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. Th=\ne lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his p=\nroduction this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Pumpdog Updated 10/21/01 =\nJefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The=\n speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good n=\numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10=\n/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orlean=\ns. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of th=\ne year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Xtreme Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught on=\nly one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give u=\np on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Count=\nryman Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on fiv=\ne catches against the Falc! on! s. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality=\n Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owners with r=\negularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - She Said Updated 10/21/01 Wa=\nrd was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still mak=\ning important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limite=\nd because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warr=\nick Dunn , RB TB - Third World Countryman Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played desp=\nite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited=\n to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht=\n , TE NYJ - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. =\nLouis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsis=\ntent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him=\n worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson ,=\n WR TB - Baby Blues Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards=\n against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB =\nBrad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numb=\ners on a regular basis.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/21=\n/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. H=\ne also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile g=\nood numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - 2700 HUEVOS Upd=\nated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 2=\n32 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured ba=\nck may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marsha=\nll Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had =\na huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score agains=\nt Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 recei=\nving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspe=\nctive.

Bu=\nt the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken D=\nilger , TE IND - Money Shots Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor =\nin the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him agains=\nt the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND -=\n High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' t=\nop option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing g=\name against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Barking Spide=\nrs Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first ga=\nme against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home=\n turf this week.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne=\n is expecte! d ! to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the sec=\nond consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your=\n Fantasy lineup.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Up=\ndated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and h=\nas burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good number=\ns against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - Money Shots Updated 10/18=\n/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He wa=\ns intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better agains=\nt them at home this week.  Randy Moss  , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated =\n10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore rig=\nht ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against=\n Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear wh=\nether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - The Replacements U=\npdated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. H=\ne is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress b=\nefore deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn, WR NE - Addison =\nRed Cornholes Updated 10/18/01Glenn might have another good game this week.=\n Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately=\n proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week. Antowain Smith , =\nRB NE - CYSWC Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the fi=\nrst time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at=\n least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chre=\nbet , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been=\n very disappointing so far. He c! ou! ld have a good week if the Jets engag=\ne in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York =\nwill center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ =\n- Team T-Bone Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for th=\ne Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs sh=\nould be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Addiso=\nn Red Cornholes Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New =\nYork offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock=\n against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Up=\ndated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday agai=\nnst Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's =\nhorrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so s=\ntarting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Fre=\ne Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday n=\night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At t=\nhis point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. =\n  Michael Westbrook , WR WA! S ! - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook=\n has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing=\n against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, =\nbut he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , =\nQB NYJ - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good sta=\nrt this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very we=\nll make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby=\n , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the w=\nork at ! ti! ght end now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrant=\ns no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Wat=\ner Boys Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questio=\nnable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fan=\ntasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - High Shrivel=\n Factor Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against=\n a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and=\n should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce  , WR S=\nTL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent =\nthus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him=\n to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Erni=\ne Conwell , TE STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a =\ndecent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring=\n on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your rost=\ner.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/18/01 Canidate w=\nill likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend =\nagainst the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is =\neasily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner ,=\n QB STL - Team T-Bone Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts=\n up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post =\nanother big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him=\n your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/18/01 B=\nuck! ha! lter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets th=\ne majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Re=\nid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be t=\nhe more productive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Addison Re=\nd Cornholes Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in th=\ne league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giant=\ns for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get hi=\nm into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - The Replacements Updated 10/=\n18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets =\nthis season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a b=\nit suspect at this point.    Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated =\n10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medi=\nal collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatle=\ny will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for=\n Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI=\n - CYSWC Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some sol=\nid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the leagu=\ne's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.=\n   More Updates   Transactions NFL Reports  [IMAGE]'); [IMAGE] 10/17 Chicag=\no Bears  Signed fullback Stanley Pritchett ; released wide receiver-kick re=\nturner Glyn Milburn .

{"text": "\n  \n  \n  \nBuffaloTheory of Beer \nThe answer to one of life's great mysteries! I haven't heard anyone\nexplain this as well as the all wise Cliff Clavin, on the sitcom Cheers. One\nafternoon at Cheers, Cliff Clavin was explaining the Buffalo Theory\nto his buddy Norm... \n\"Well ya see Norm, it's like this... A herd of buffalo can only move\nas fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the\nslowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural\nselection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health\nof the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest\nmembers.\" \nHe continues: \"In much the same way, the human brain can only operate\nas fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we\nall know, kills brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and\nweakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer\neliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient\nmachine.  That's why you always feel smarter after a few beers.\" \n  "}

The Third Party Sales Group, which was established less than five months ago, has already signed up more than 24,000 customers.\n\nThe Mid Market group is also bringing new customers into the fold. In these first few weeks of Q4, the Mid Market group has added Boston Market and Holiday Inn in New York, Moody Gardens and American National Insurance Company in Galveston, the Jewish Community Center Houston, Gulf Coast Retailers Association, El Fenix Restaurants in Dallas and Maxim. \n \nThe commercial, manufacturing/industrial and regional commodity groups are continuing to offer EES' products and services to large business consumers and have successfully brought in several large deals over the past few weeks.

Of the potential options considered outside of a merger, few could provide \"the earnings potential and immediate synergies\" that a combination with Dynegy could provide according to Greg Whalley, Enron president and chief operating officer. \n\nThe new organization will focus on core businesses including wholesale energy markets and commercial and industrial energy users.

During the call, Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron, reviewed occurrences which led to the current loss in investor confidence and decline in liquidity such as bad investments, \"perceived\" conflicts of interest in related-party transactions, lack of transparency and errors in financial statements. \"We fully understand and regret the combination of events that have resulted in loss of investor confidence,\" said Lay, and we \"are fully committed to fixing the problems.\" \n\nIn an effort to restore operational and financial momentum, Enron will be split into Core and Non-Core businesses and Businesses Under Review. \n?\tThe core businesses which were performing at all time highs prior to the events that lead to the merger with    \tDynegy provide \"significant earnings and cash flow opportunities with unique competitive advantages,\" \t\taccording to Greg Whalley, president and chief operating officer. Core businesses include the natural gas \t\tpipeline business, and the gas and power, retail and coal busniesses in North America and Europe.\n?\tNon-core businesses such as broadband and Azurix will be divested and the earnings will be used to repay \t\tdebt and reinvest in core businesses. \n?\tBusinesses Under Review are potential future markets outside of power and gas wholesale businesses. \n \nThe conference call is separated into five sections: Introduction, Business Overview, Business Segment Update, Financial Review and Outlook and Q&A session for easy access to needed information. Click here  to listen to the conference call.\n\nDynegy and Enron Investor Conference Call: In Monday morning's conference call, Dynegy and Enron executives reviewed the merger details and fielded questions from investors. Chuck Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive officer, reiterated the strength of Enron's core business units and the high level of integrity of the people working in the trenches. Watson and Ken Lay also spoke of the advantages that Enron's business units would bring to the new organization with Watson making specific note of EES. \"EES is three to five years ahead of Dynegy's retail unit\" and is an \"earnings contributor and growth engine that will continue in the combined company\" according to Watson. The conference call replay will be available until 5:00 p.m. EST, Monday, November 26.

Bowen, Jr., the former chief operating officer of Enron Industrial Markets, has been elected as the new executive vice president - finance and treasurer. \"Ray has extremely good credibility with the investment community,\" according to Ken Lay and is \"well respected and trusted by banks and other financial institutions.\" \n\n\nEES Customer Corner\nStarwood Makes the Grade: EES customer, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. earned the distinction of having over 30 of its top hotels and resorts included in Conde Nast Traveler's 2001 Readers' Choice Awards List. The November 2001 edition of Conde Nast Traveler includes the magazine's 14th Annual Readers' Choice Awards that features the Top 100 \"Best in the World\" list which rates the best in hotels, resorts, cities, islands, cruise lines, airlines and car rentals.

{"text": "Improving odds in online gambling\nBy William Spain, CBS.MarketWatch.com\nLast Update: 11:20 AM ET Jan. 31, 2002\n\n\n\n\nSome sites safer than others for betting the Super\nBowl\n\nCHICAGO (CBS.MW) - Fear flying to Vegas? Can't find a\nfriend to cover the spread? Just longing to get some\naction on the Big Game?\n\nDon't sweat: There's still time to bypass the bookie\nfor a browser.\n\nWhile credit-card issuers are making it harder for\nAmericans to lay money down online for Super Bowl\nXXXVI (See full story), there are plenty of Web-based\nsportsbooks ready, willing and able to take their\nwagers.\n\nThe trick is figuring out which sites to trust - and\nto make sure a winning hunch gets paid off in full and\non time.\n\nThe sheer number of operators, along with their\nquasi-legal status and offshore locations, complicates\nthat task. But following a few simple rules can\ndrastically decrease the odds of being victimized by a\nwelshing Webmaster.\n\n\"I would never, ever, play at a casino or sportsbook\nthat doesn't have their phone number available.\"\n\nEric Morris,publisher, Online Gambling Magazine\n\n\nBy most accounts, the majority of Internet gambling\nsites are run honestly. Like the brick-and-mortar\ncasinos they often compete with, the sites don't have\nto cheat to make money. And while there have been\ninstances of bettors getting stiffed, it's far more\nlikely to occur due to incompetence rather than\ndeliberate rip-off.\n\nThe very first thing to look at before placing any bet\nonline, industry experts seem to agree, is whether the\nsite has actual human beings readily on hand to answer\nquestions, try to resolve disputes, etc.\n\n\"I would never, ever, play at a casino or sportsbook\nthat doesn't have their phone number available,\" said\nEric Morris, publisher of Online Gambling Magazine.\n\nSpot checks\n\nNext, do the research. Check the message boards at\nreview sites like winneronline and casinomeister to\nsee what is being said about who and why. Crooks and\ncretins alike can get called to account pretty fast in\ncyberspace; if people are complaining about a specific\nsite, stay away.\n\nMorris also recommends that players \"stay with sites\nthat are advertising in multiple publications and\nnewspapers\" instead of just using cheap or no-cost\nonline banners. With that kind of marketing\ninvestment, \"chances are they are legitimate and will\npay you out.\"\n\nSue Schneider, chief executive of River City Group, an\ninteractive gambling research, publishing and\nbrokerage firm, echoed Morris' sentiments about what\nconsumers should check before placing an online bet\nfor the first time. To the list, she adds \"they should\nsee if a site is licensed by a specific government and\nif it has a 'Seal of Approval' from the Interactive\nGaming Council.\"\n\nAlthough betting sites operate in some European\ncountries and Australia, they will not usually take\nwagers from people in the U.S. Among the\nmultinationals currently getting a taste of that\naction are Playboy Enterprises(PLA: news, chart,\nprofile), Sun International (SIH: news, chart,\nprofile) and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. (NWS: news,\nchart, profile)\n\nTop jurisdictions\n\nWhile it's not actually illegal as yet for Americans\nto make bets online, the issue is such a political hot\npotato here that regulators in other industrialized\nnations have taken a pass on the market for now.\n\nMeanwhile, formal regulations for South-of-the-Border\noperators vary from the relatively stringent and\nrecently upgraded, in Antigua, to the virtually\nnon-existent, in Costa Rica.\n\nFrank Catania, head of an interactive gambling\nconsultancy that bears his name, is a former director\nof gaming enforcement for New Jersey - the nation's\nNo. 2 casino market after Nevada. He describes himself\nas a proponent of \"player protection\" via strict\nregulations.\n\nPlayers \"need to look for a site that comes from a\njurisdiction with significant gaming regulation\" he\nsaid, and named Antigua as the best of the Caribbean\n-- in no small part because he helped draw their\nrulebook. He says other good sites are run out of\nAustralia, the Isle of Man and from a Mohawk Indian\nreservation in Canada.\n\nIn these locales, at least, \"a consumer can feel\nrelatively safe that they are going to get paid,\" he\nsaid.\n\nSteve Schillinger is director of wagering at World\nSports Exchange. Based in Antigua, it's one of the\nmost-established online bookmakers, up and running\nsince 1996. Schillinger claims a customer base of\n30,000 and says \"on a typical Sunday in football\nseason, we process over 200 bets a minute.\"\n\nWays around\n\nSchillinger says his company hasn't experienced any\nproblems with credit cards yet, but that it's still\neasy to bet should your issuer balk. There are other\nways to set up an account, including wire transfers.\n\nWinnings typically are sent via overnight mail, he\nsays, and can be considerable: World Sports Exchange's\nlimit is $20,000 per bet and people will sometimes\nmake as many as five bets on a single game.\n\n\"Business for us is very good,\" he said. \"We increase\nabout 50 percent in volume every year.\"\n\nThose kind of numbers are one of the main factors that\nhave some U.S. casino companies panting for a piece of\nthe action. The management of MGM Mirage (MGG: news,\nchart, profile)is among the industry's more outspoken\nboosters of the potential of online gambling.\n\nTheir counterparts at archrival Park Place (PPE: news,\nchart, profile) are more low-key about it, but they've\nalso indicated they don't intend to be left behind.\nTheir theory is, when Vegas operators enter the\nbusiness, they'll grab market share and greatly\nexpanding the pie by providing bettors with U.S.-based\nbrand name service.\n\nThey also could leverage their existing databases to\ndrive business and use a \"comp\" system to reward\nplayers with free rooms, trips to Las Vegas and other\ncherished amenities.\n\nThat may pose something of challenge to sites like\nSchillinger's - if it ever happens. In the meantime,\nhe asks with obvious self-interest, \"Where is your\nsafer bet? With a local bookmaker or a reputable\nonline company that pays everybody?\"\n\nAnyone care to wager on that one?\n\nWilliam Spain is a reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com in\nChicago\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGreat stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo!

He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Min=\nnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury.   =\nReggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to published =\nreports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend=\n against Carolina! . ! He won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so =\ndon't bother starting him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Third World C=\nountryman Updated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunda=\ny's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and=\n Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve=\n McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with a=\nn injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss =\nsome practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's=\n next game.   Packers , DT GB - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/19/01 Safet=\ny LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's gam=\ne against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of t=\nhe season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler'=\ns absence.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/19/01 McNair was a=\nble to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tenne! ss! ean says =\nhe will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able=\n to play in the team's next game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Xtreme Updated=\n 11/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury=\n. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day.   Reggie Wayne ,=\n WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sun=\nday. His current status is day to day.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods U=\npdated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status fo=\nr Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Thi=\nrd World Countryman Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the=\n season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered =\na mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weeken=\nd's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Upd=\nated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's ga=\nme against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as=\n day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders=\n had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 y=\nards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is=\n listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updat! ed! 11/=\n19/01  Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's rea=\ndy to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few=\n more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to eva=\nluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade =\nvalue in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - The Leather Cheerios Upd=\nated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's deci=\nsion not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an =\nankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have bee=\nn able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantas=\ny value might drop greatly. Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/0=\n1 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning New=\ns is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the ti=\nme being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Footba=\nll.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sun=\nday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His sta=\ntus for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time.   =\nTony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a con=\ncussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that =\nthere's a \"definite possibility\" he would be ready in time for next weekend=\n's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to=\n play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles.  =\n Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Su=\nnday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expec=\nted to be in the starting l! in! eup when Dallas faces Denver on Thanksgivi=\nng Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Foster suffer=\ned an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is liste=\nd as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 How=\nard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not=\n return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET -=\n Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's=\n game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR C=\nAR - KMB Express Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Su=\nnday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atla=\nnta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/18/01 Ande=\nrson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. ! Ol! and=\nis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is =\nno longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continu=\ne to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third Worl=\nd Countryman Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards an=\nd a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and=\n Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plum=\nmer , QB ARI - She Said Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four =\nTDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare=\n for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman =\n, RB ARI - Cali Bound Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pi=\nttman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcomin=\ng weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Pumpd=\nog Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards a=\nt Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consid! er! Sloan, who alwa=\nys gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Ag=\nent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and cau=\nght 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature =\nWarren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a go=\nod Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third W=\norld Countryman Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards agains=\nt the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count=\n on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. H=\ne can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Bab=\ny Blues Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the =\nBears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson =\ndown the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  More Updates [I=\nMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent wee=\nks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents cont=\ninue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Xtreme Updated 11/25/=\n01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards=\n against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy ri! sk=\n! because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - She Said Updated =\n11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his=\n quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any =\nFantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in th=\ne AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/25/01 Brooki=\nns rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble.=\n The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most=\n teams right no! w.!   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Cali Bound Updated 11/25/01 Day=\nne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on=\n him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB=\n NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and=\n a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played w=\nell recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a mo=\nre consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Hillrods Updated 11=\n/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day agains=\nt Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, includi=\nng 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hi=\nllrods Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and=\n two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the=\n matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - She ! Sa! id Update=\nd 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a t=\nouchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a re=\nserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods U=\npdated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes fo=\nr 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliabl=\ne Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.=\n   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Countryman Updated 11/25/01 Jackson=\n had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards =\nand a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he=\n is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - The Leather Chee=\nrios Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes f=\nor 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in re=\ncent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB O=\nAK - Xtreme Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley car=\nried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in=\n short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting f=\nor any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he m=\nay not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smi=\nth , RB NE - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense=\n and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has beco=\nme a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE -=\n Baby Blues Updated 1! 1/! 25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orle=\nans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty re=\nliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on=\n the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea=\n Circus Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no inter=\nceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continu=\ned to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , =\nWR ARI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01Sanders left Sunday's game against San=\n Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay J=\nenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - 2700 HUEVOS=\n Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching s=\nix passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, a=\nnd Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointme=\nnt for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing o=\nf the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agen=\nt! Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards,=\n three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy con=\nsideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gads=\nden , WR MIA - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 11=\n8 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. =\nGadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these importan=\nt final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/25/01Fi=\nedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His p=\nerformance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still =\ntoo inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - =\n2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards a=\nnd 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia =\nQB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI=\n - Pumpdog Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught fo! ur! passes for 32 yards again=\nst Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy tea=\nms as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Baby Blues Updated 11=\n/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie h=\nas slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a ris=\nk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Up=\ndated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis playe=\nd through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good ba=\nckup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known =\nto battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/0=\n1 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted=\n decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 =\nyards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - KMB =\nExpress Updated 11/25/01 Muhamm! ad! missed Sunday's game against Atlanta d=\nue to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orl=\neans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Update=\nd 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a ri=\nb injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy=\n disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - The Wounded=\n Ducks Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for =\nonly 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with =\ntheir ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers=\n.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught =\ntwo passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open of=\nten, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays =\nhealthy.

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crocke=\ntt may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Water Boy=\ns Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to p=\nlay half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start =\nfrom a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11=\n/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cinci=\nnnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual dr=\nills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite =\nnot being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Em=\nmitt Smith , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to =\nthe lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprai=\nned right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice =\nthat Smith would \"be ready to play the majority of the game.\" His return bu=\nmps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either bac=\nk against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison=\n Red Cornholes Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL in=\njury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game a=\ngainst Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a=\n larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit sec=\nondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke ,=\n QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weink=\ne will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco.=\n However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper =\n, QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a =\ngood Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense =\nthis season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fanta=\nsy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   =\nCris Carter , WR MIN - Money Shots Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be=\n down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benchi=\nng. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a goo=\nd game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday nig=\nht.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Moss is liste=\nd as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle inj=\nury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to be=\nnch him based on his potential to p! os! t solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky W=\nilliams , RB NO - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the be=\ntter Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly b=\nasis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all s=\neason long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - The Rep=\nlacements Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last=\n weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsiste=\nnt this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to be=\nnch him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Ja=\nckson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up =\na huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 =\nyards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulne=\nrable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid opti=\non.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lak! e ! Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/16=\n/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's a=\nveraged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerg=\ning as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a D=\nenver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB W=\nAS - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, thr=\nowing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this=\n weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's=\n only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook ,=\n WR WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent th=\nis season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games.=\n He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so =\nstarting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS=\n - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last t=\nwo games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable=\n matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good mo=\nve.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/16/01 Hakim =\nhas been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team=\n is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New E=\nngland secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.=\n   Torry Holt , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/16/01 Holt continue=\ns to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touc=\nhdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, =\nbut he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential t=\no put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated=\n 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's=\n still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and t=\nhe formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on=\n his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Dallas De! mo! =\nn Horde Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving th=\nat he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start eve=\nry week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Er=\nnie Conwell , TE STL - Barking Spiders Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a f=\new down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble=\n. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting =\nConwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   R=\nichard Huntley  , RB CAR - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/16/01 Huntley wil=\nl be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be su=\nrprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back i=\nn Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Water Boys Updated =\n11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. L=\nouis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him =\nis a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/0=\n1 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still on=\ne of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San=\n Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , W=\nR CAR - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat=\n productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's =\nhad some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, s=\no starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Water Boys Updated=\n 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league=\n this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable s=\necondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - The=\n Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, =\nbut his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player=\n. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tig=\nht end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - The=\n Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL i=\nnjury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a so=\nlid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong=\n passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Upda=\nted 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit'=\ns backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much =\nFantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble=\n.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely=\n start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He'=\ns split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last =\nresort in larger Fantasy leagues.

{"text": "With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.\n\nFirst, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.\n\nThe Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.\n\nSteve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  \n\nAs you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.\n\nIn addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.\n\nWe will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.\n\nThank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.\n\nLink to the press release: http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/012902Release.html\n"}

{"text": "\nAs the  creator of the algebraic mean sequenced draft order that was built to eliminate  the inherent advantage that the #1 & #14 teams had by getting back to back  picks every other round, I think the time for mathematical preciseness has  passed.  I'm all for going to a simplified traditional snake system.   Frankly, at this point I think there are as many disadvantages to being 1 or 14  (or 2 - 13) as advantages that it all works itself out.

We will still have  a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise players.  Then  the non-franchise teams will pick in opposite order of the supplemental round  for round one...thus if you pick first in the supplemental round, you will  pick last (for those that did not keep franchise players) in the first  round.  Then, the teams that kept franchise players will be randomly  selected to pick at the end of the first round.  After the first round,  the draft will snake back the other way with the last pick in the first round  getting the first pick in the second round and the draft will continue in this  snake order until the end of the draft.

To customi=\nze, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports=\n, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - She=\n Said Updated 11/21/01 Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday tha=\nt indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months a=\nnd possibly the remainder of the season, according to the Florida Times-Uni=\non. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need mo=\nre time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain in=\n his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Tay=\nlor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably h=\nold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep en=\nough bench.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Updated 11/21/01 Smith's spr=\nained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there=\n is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered=\n the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should pro=\nbably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your =\nexpectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't=\n the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexand=\ner , RB SEA - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expe=\ncted to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal po=\nint of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. H=\ne should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady=\n , QB NE - Baby Blues Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady f=\nor now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. \"I don't see any =\nchanges this week,\" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy sta=\nrter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if yo=\nu can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may hav=\ne to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's=\n status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The W=\nounded Ducks Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed=\n enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times. He is not expected to =\nreturn for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continu=\ne to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into=\n view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillrods Update! d ! 11/20/01 Mike Riley =\ntold the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Fluti=\ne and rookie Drew Brees. \"Doug is going to be our quarterback,\" he said. \"Y=\nou can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this b=\nuilding. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win =\nthe next week.\" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most F=\nantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener=\n will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His los=\ns may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely=\n regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley =\n, RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he =\nis no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.=\n  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Baby Blues Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may pla=\ny this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practic=\ne early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The Leather Cheerios Updated 1=\n1/20/01Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a ri=\nsky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated 11/20/01 Th=\ne Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's prac=\ntice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss=\n any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - She Said Update=\nd 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to sta=\nrt against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Cali Bound Updated 11/20/01 Min=\nnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have =\nto start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01=\n Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game agai=\nnst New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome P=\nathon , WR IND - Xtreme Updated 11! /2! 0/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the =\nseason. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurt=\ning, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting=\n lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/20/01 Dave W=\nannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Field=\ner and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Ja=\ny is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away=\n and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - The Hillrods Upda=\nted 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be s=\nufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. \"We'll g=\net a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,\" Shanahan told the De=\nnver Post. \"If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situ=\nation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, =\nthen we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.\"   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE =\n- Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis w=\non't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. \"We'll try to get =\nhim involved in some of the games,\" Davis said. \"We'll see.\"   Kevin Locket=\nt , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury=\n last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphi=\na. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this=\n point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any set=\nbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suff=\nered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after ef=\nfects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Gr=\neen , WR TB - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to r=\neturn to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent thi=\ns season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens ,=\n WR SF - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained lef=\nt knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against=\n Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is ex=\npected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin =\n, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury d=\nuring Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but =\nis expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has n=\no real value as a Fantasy player, but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley. =\n   Giants , DT NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 According to the =\nNew York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee beg=\nan giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsur=\ne that he'd be! a! ble to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday =\nnight, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you sh=\nould consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season=\n.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/20/01 The Baltim=\nore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team=\n's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most F=\nantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver i=\ns still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's gam=\ne against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy playe=\nr at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Xtreme Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end=\n Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee sur=\ngery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defens=\ne and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowb=\noys , DT DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakl=\ney, who was ! ex! pected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will lik=\nely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help=\n keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give=\n Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - =\nPierres Flea Circus Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's =\ngame against Denver. \"I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my =\njob,\" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fant=\nasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if a=\nt all possible.

{"text": "We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.\n\nWe had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.\n\nPrior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly."}

He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.   Ron Dixon=\n , WR NYG  Updated 10/24/01 Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained =\nankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.  Joe =\nJurevi! ci! us , WR NYG  Updated 10/24/01 Ike Hilliard regained his startin=\ng position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jureviciu=\ns was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be us=\neless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to star=\nting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this sea=\nson. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game whil=\ne Toomer stood on the sidelines.   Reggie Swinton , WR DAL  Updated 10/24/0=\n1 Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sund=\nay's game against Arizona. \"He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday=\n and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be av=\nailable,\" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini an! d ! Raghib Isma=\nil will get more playing time in his absence.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL  Upd=\nated 10/24/01 Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game again=\nst the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playi=\nng. He is recovering from a sprained foot. \"We're expecting some limited pr=\nactice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that=\n it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,\" said head c=\noach Dave Campo.     Darrin Chiaverini , WR DAL  Updated 10/24/01 Chiaverin=\ni practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the =\nCardinals. ! He! is recovering from a left knee injury.   Raghib Ismail , W=\nR DAL  Updated 10/24/01 Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced =\nMonday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.=\n   Ricky Watters , RB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tr=\nibune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to t=\nhe starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or=\n longer. \"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,\" Holmgren said. \"I wo=\nuld be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our =\nbest player when! h! e got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played w=\nell. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again.\" If yo=\nu have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your=\n team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander do=\nwn the stretch.   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable=\n to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB j=\nob to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this poin=\nt.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA  Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seaha=\nwks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the=\n Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Has=\nselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorabl=\ne matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fan! ta! sy perspective, so don't use him t=\nhis week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ  Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Ch=\nrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an M=\nRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday =\nagainst the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA  Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monda=\ny's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at =\nSeattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  La=\nmar Smith , RB MIA  Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to a=\nn ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be=\n afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC  Updated 10/23/01 Chie=\nfs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chr=\nis Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you u=\nse either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imp=\nosing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome=\n Pathon , WR IND  Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight gam=\ne Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this =\nweek.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND  Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable =\nfor Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend y=\nou use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN  Updated =\n10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his =\ncomeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not deci=\nded whether they will activate him. He will work in p! ra! ctice this week =\nand the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't =\nrecommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain =\nhe's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick D=\nunn , RB TB  Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn d=\noesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't prac=\ntice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday =\nagainst Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI  Updated 10/23/01 Staley started =\nMonday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carr=\nied the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the gam=\ne by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in t=\nhe game. ! At! this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consisten=\nt Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a so=\nlid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN  Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a n=\neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinn=\ney , TE TEN  Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report be=\ncause of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game=\n.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN  Updated 10/23/01 D! ys! on is recovering from a t=\nhumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. =\nHe is expected to participate in practice.   Eddie George , RB TEN  Updated=\n 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected t=\no play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 10/23/01 McNai=\nr is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. Ho=\nwever, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN=\n  Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem i=\nn his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week.=\n Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect =\nSanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.=\n   Damon Jones , TE JAC  Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume pract=\nicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not=\n require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC  Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been =\nruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his! s! tatus for next wee=\nk's game remains uncertain. \"All I know is that, from week to week, they in=\ncrease his exercises and change of direction,\" head coach Tom Coughlin told=\n The Florida Times-Union. \"It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to =\nplay. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can =\nmake some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week.\" Taylor=\n has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis=\n Northcutt , WR CLE  Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because =\nof a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action ne=\nxt week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL  Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday bu=\nt head coach ! Br! ian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that=\n the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the l=\nast four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL  Updated=\n 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a spra=\nined ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start=\n at running back if Allen is inactive.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 20=\n01 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Bri=\nan Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BA=\nL  Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspende=\nd for four games for violating the NFL's drug and alcohol policy. Lewis' fo=\nur-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allow! ed!=\n to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17=\n. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee. =\n  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sun=\nday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's f=\neature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wych=\neck , TE TEN  Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is e=\nxpected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a =\nrisky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 11/=\n16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincin=\nnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual dri=\nlls Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite n=\not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emm=\nitt Smith , RB DAL  Updated 11/16/01 Smith will ret! ur! n to the lineup Su=\nnday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right kne=\ne. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith wo=\nuld \"be ready to play the majority of the game.\" His return bumps Troy Hamb=\nrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the=\n stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI  Updated 11/16/01 Sand=\ners (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now lis=\nted as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're =\ncompletely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' m=\natchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long =\nas he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 11/16/01 According =\nto published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's =\ngame against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantas=\ny team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace=\n for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's o=\nffense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from =\na Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly ba=\nsis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down =\nsomewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. Th=\ne veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game=\n against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   =\nRandy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday=\n's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachi=\neving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his pot=\nential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO  Updated 11/=\n16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a g=\nood player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense tha=\nt has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.    =\n Aaron Brooks , QB NO  Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San F=\nrancisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a b=\nit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes i=\nt tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.=\n !   Willie Jackson , WR NO  Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game ag=\nainst San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receivin=\ng. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the p=\nass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen =\nDavis , RB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginn=\ning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four g=\names, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the=\n start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scori=\nng games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of =\nlate, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good mat=\nchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air,=\n but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael We=\nstbrook , WR WAS  Updated 11/16! /0!  Westbrook has been inconsistent this =\nseason, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He=\n'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so sta=\nrting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS  U=\npdated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catch=\ning only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this w=\neekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir =\nHakim , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01  Hakim has been inconsistent in recent wee=\nks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is =\nright. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so av=\noid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL  Updated 11/=\n16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only sco=\nred only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secon=\ndary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based=\n on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL  Updated =\n11/16/01! Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's=\n still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and t=\nhe formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on=\n his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL  Updated 11/16/01=\n Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best =\nFantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post=\n solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL  Up=\ndated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fa=\nntasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end aro=\nund the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners =\nwill have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR  Updated 11/16/01=\n Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but=\n don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting e=\nither back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR  Updated =\n11/16/01 Hayes had on! ly! two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St=\n. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting h=\nim is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR  Updated 11/16/01 Walls has b=\neen held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the bett=\ner tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in=\n the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR  Update=\nd 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six pa=\nsses for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past agai=\nnst this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move. =\n  Brett Favre , QB GB  Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fant=\nasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on S=\nunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week=\n.   Bubba Franks , TE GB  Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yarda=\nge numbers, but his seven tou! ch! downs in eight games makes him a valuabl=\ne Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is=\n the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroed=\ner , WR GB  Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL inj=\nury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a soli=\nd play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong p=\nassing teams like Green Bay.

Player Updates Scouting Reports   [IMAGE]'); [IMAGE]   L=\natest NFL Player News    Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN  Updated 10/25/01   Batt=\naglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but =\nis expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN=\n  Updated 10/25/01   Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a brok=\nen clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined =\nfor several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in hi=\ns absence.     Chris Sanders  , WR TEN  Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has resp=\nonded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashvi=\nlle Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-orie=\nnted team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Whe=\natley  , RB OAK  Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday bec=\nause of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contr=\na Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable for =\nSunday's game against the Eagles.     Keyshawn Johnson  , WR TB  Updated 10=\n/25/01   Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did not practice Wedn=\nesday, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Johnson is recovering from h=\nip and thigh injuries but is expected to play Sunday.     Jacquez Green  , =\nWR TB  Updated 10/25/01   Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game=\n against Minnesota. He is recovering from a groin strain. Frank Murphy will=\n replace Green at receiver if he is unable to play.     Warrick Dunn  , RB =\nTB  Updated 10/25/01   Dunn participated in running drills Wednesday and di=\nd not have any setbacks in his recovery from a toe injury, according to The=\n St. Petersburg Times . Nevertheless, Dunn is still listed as questionable =\nfor this week's game against Minnesota.     Ike Hilliard  , WR NYG  Updated=\n 10/25/01   Hillard is suffering from soreness in his surgically-repaired f=\noot, according to the New York Newsday . The foot was sore following the Gi=\nants game against St. Louis in Week Five but it is even more sore now. Keep=\n an eye on this situation. This condition might force Hilliard to the sidel=\nines if it intensifies.     Damon Jones  , TE JAC  Updated 10/25/01   Jones=\n' status for this week's game is questionable, according to The Florida Tim=\nes-Union . He missed practice on Wednesday because of a shoulder injury. Ky=\nle Brady will get most of the looks at tight end if Jones is unable to play=\n.     Elvis Joseph  , RB JAC  Updated 10/25/01   Joseph took a lot of snaps=\n in practice Wednesday and will be incorporated in as the third-down back, =\naccording to The Florida Times-Union . Joseph won't have much value in this=\n job but he will take carries away from starter Stacey Mack.     Tyrone Dav=\nis  , TE GB  Updated 10/25/01   Davis could return from his hamstring injur=\ny sooner than what was originally expected, according to published reports.=\n He might begin practicing next week and will almost certainly be activated=\n before his target date of Thanksgiving. Davis has been sidelined since Aug=\nust because of hamstring surgery. Nevertheless, he will be the No. 2 tight =\nend when he returns.     Elvis Grbac  , QB BAL  Updated 10/25/01   Grbac wi=\nll likely be a game-time decision for Sunday's game, according to The Balti=\nmore Sun . He threw very little in practice and is still suffering from a s=\nore chest. Randall Cunningham will start if Grbac is unable to play.      R=\nandy Moss  , WR MIN  Updated 10/25/01   Moss is suffering from tendonitis i=\nn his left Achilles tendon, according to The Pioneer Press . Moss missed pr=\nactice Wednesday but is expected to play on Sunday.     Tony Martin  , WR A=\nTL  Updated 10/25/01   Martin might be ready to play when the Falcons resum=\ne their season on November 4. He has been sidelined for the past four games=\n because of a broken collarbone but the Atlanta Journal-constitution report=\ns that he ran routes on Wednesday and caught some passes.     Wane McGarity=\n  , WR DAL  Updated 10/25/01   The Saints have signed McGarity, who was rel=\neased by the Cowboys earlier this season. McGarity will be used mostly on r=\neturns, but he might eventually work his way into the Saints' regular rotat=\nion of receivers.     Matt Stover  , K BAL  Updated 10/25/01   Stover has a=\n minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be abl=\ne to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't con=\nsidered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holm=\nes as candidates to handle kickoffs.     Eric Metcalf  , WR OAK  Updated 10=\n/25/01   The Washington Redskins signed Metcalf on Wednesday. He will be us=\ned mostly as a returner and has minimal Fantasy value.      Tim Biakabutuka=\n  , RB CAR  Updated 10/25/01   Biakabutuka will be out until at least train=\ning camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. \"He=\n's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football relat=\ned until next summer,\" coach George Seifert said Wednesday. \"Basically, it =\njust separated,\" Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. \"The l=\nigaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together.\" R=\nichard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visite=\nd his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far wor=\nse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again.       =\n James Stewart  , RB DET  Updated 10/25/01   Stewart will probably play on =\nSunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle i=\nnjury has now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain.     Wayne C=\nhrebet  , WR NYJ  Updated 10/25/01   Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiv=\ner, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in t=\nhe helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and lef=\nt the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive week tha=\nt a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over=\n Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebe=\nt's ailment as \"post-trauma migraines\" and said he wanted to be extra cauti=\nous with the injury.  Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and sca=\nns he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. =\nRookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup.       Terrell Davis =\n , RB DEN  Updated 10/25/01   Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stre=\nss fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. \"At this point in =\ntime, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,\" Davis said. Davis, who has miss=\ned five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee rem=\nains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past t=\nwo weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared f=\nor this week's game against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as q=\nuestionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abi=\nlities will be limited if he does play Sunday.        Clint Stoerner  , QB =\nDAL  Updated 10/25/01   Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice=\n Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. H=\nead coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wrigh=\nt isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a ri=\nsky move. Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started i=\nn the NFL. He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for =\n44 yards and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season.       Antho=\nny Wright  , QB DAL  Updated 10/25/01   Wright didn't practice Wednesday be=\ncause of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright mig=\nht not play Sunday.   Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursd=\nay, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's p=\nlaying status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoer=\nner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Ca=\nmpo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Su=\nnday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a star=\nting spot yet.        Terrell Davis  , RB DEN  Updated 10/24/01   Davis is =\nsufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is givin=\ng him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays r=\nevealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbb=\ning. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able t=\no play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited.    Amani Toomer  , W=\nR NYG  Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be b=\nenched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if =\nToomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the=\n Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim=\n Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayne=\n Chrebet  , WR NYJ  Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at C=\narolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailmen=\nt as \"post-trauma migraines\" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with t=\nhe injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was=\n given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who =\nplayed in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has no=\nw been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yard=\ns in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN  Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will=\n not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving a=\nn injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE  Updated =\n10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Li=\nons are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-en=\nding injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the jo=\nb. Don't bother picking him up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT  Updated 10/24/01  =\n Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Mond=\nay's game against Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET  Updated 10/24/01=\n   The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a to=\nrn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:\n\n1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.\n\n2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  \n\nFor information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.  "}

Wright expected to have results of an MR=\nI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the qu=\narterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo sai=\nd Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to pl=\nay Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the =\nCowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to=\n merit a starting spot yet.        Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Lake Austin Mi=\nghty Mullets Updated 10/24/01   Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee s=\nurgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday whe=\nn told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and =\ncould be lost for the season.   \"At this point in time, I'm on schedule to =\nplay this Sunday,\" Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains=\n sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two w=\neeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questi=\nonable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - Team T-Bo=\nne Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be bench=\ned in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toom=\ner is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eag=\nles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fas=\nsel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayne Chr=\nebet  , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sunda=\ny's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chr=\nebet's ailment as \"post-trauma migraines\" and said he wanted to be extra ca=\nutious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and=\n scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-ol=\nd rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past ye=\nar. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catc=\nh for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Update=\nd 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-ev=\naluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert E=\nmanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the Det=\nroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help=\n fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanue=\nl won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    Hin=\nes Ward  , WR PIT - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day wi=\nth an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tenn=\nessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Team T-Bone Updated 10/24/01   The De=\ntroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patell=\na tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ=\n - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is stil=\nl a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The =\nearliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB -=\n Water Boys Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to gene=\nral soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully r=\necovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Team T-Bone Up=\ndated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to th=\ne starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still wor=\nking with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which pl=\nayer will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - =\nFree Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster =\nis expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. =\nFoster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leag=\nues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robi=\nnson  , WR CHI - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson=\n on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effect=\nively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Ne=\nil Rackers  , K CIN - South Park Cows Updated 10/24/01   According to the C=\nincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign=\n one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk becaus=\ne of his erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - The Replacements Update=\nd 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunda=\ny's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR N=\nYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sp=\nrained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week=\n.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/24/01   Ike H=\nilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the =\nrole of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's abs=\nence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance =\nthat he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer ha=\ns been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few=\n times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swi=\nnton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a =\nhamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. \"He=\n [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he d=\nidn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,\" said head coach Dave=\n Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in h=\nis absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/24/=\n01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Ca=\nrdinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is=\n recovering from a sprained foot. \"We're expecting some limited practice to=\nmorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will =\ndepend on how he improves the next two or three days,\" said head coach Dave=\n Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   C=\nhiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game agai=\nnst the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.     Raghib Ism=\nail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering from a spr=\nained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable=\n for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - The Replacements Updat=\ned 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mi=\nke Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as=\n he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. \"We'll cross that br=\nidge when we come to it,\" Holmgren said. \"I would be surprised if I didn't =\ninsert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt.=\n Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that wh=\nen Ricky can play, he'll play again.\" If you have the roster room, it would=\n be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if W=\natters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Trent Dilfer =\n , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to practice on =\nMonday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasse=\nlbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    Matt Hasse=\nlbeck  , QB SEA - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck =\nwill be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami,=\n according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, wh=\no stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn=\n't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so d=\non't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Update=\nd 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's=\n game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent o=\nf the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR =\nMIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a =\nfoot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a u=\nseful Fantasy player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA =\n- Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an =\nankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be a=\nfraid to use him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated=\n 10/23/01   Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might st=\nart ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't=\n recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' seconda=\nry is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter th=\nis week.    Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01 =\n  Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to =\na sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR I=\nND - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday'=\ns game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in=\n a Fantasy league this week.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]=\n   CYSWC Player News    Joe Nedney  , Active K Updated 10/23/01  Nedney suf=\nfered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.    =\nChris Chandler  , Reserve QB Updated 10/22/01  Chandler had another solid g=\name Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and 39 yards. He also completed =\n14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to be an adequate starter for t=\nhe rest of the season.    Darnay Scott  , Active WR Updated 10/22/01  Scott=\n suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss next w=\neek's game against Detroit.    J.R. Redmond  , Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01 =\n Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry =\nfor no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.   =\n Maurice Smith  , Active RB Updated 10/22/01  Smith suffered a sprained kne=\ne Sunday but is expected to play in the Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a b=\nye this week and doesn't play again until November 4.    Derrick Alexander =\n , Active WR Updated 10/21/01  Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99=\n yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for =\nthe most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes i=\nt tough to bench him.    Desmond Clark  , Reserve TE Updated 10/21/01  Clar=\nk had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score ag=\nainst San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy =\nperspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.    Corey Dillon  ,=\n Active RB Updated 10/21/01  The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 c=\narries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performa=\nnce very quickly.    Derrick Mason  , Active WR Updated 10/21/01  Mason (an=\nkle) is expected to start on Sunday against Detroit. With the Lions' second=\nary in shambles, starting Mason is a good decision for Fantasy owners with =\na thin group of receivers.    Jeff Garcia  , Active QB Updated 10/18/01  Ac=\ncording to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a f=\nootball until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealin=\ng with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and brui=\nses. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. =\n28 against Chicago.    Antowain Smith  , Reserve RB Updated 10/18/01  Smith=\n rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this yea=\nr. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second=\n meeting with Indianapolis.    Chad Lewis  , Active TE Updated 10/18/01  Le=\nwis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday=\n against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and shoul=\nd be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.    Antonio Freeman  , Reser=\nve WR Updated 10/14/01  Freeman caught nine passes for 138 yards and TD aga=\ninst Baltimore. His fine numbers against the AFC's top defense are a clear =\nsignal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy wideout, despite his quiet s=\ntart prior to this week.    Raiders  , Active DT Updated 10/02/01  The Raid=\ners have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore h=\nis Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery th=\nis week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In ot=\nher news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dal=\nlas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is qu=\nestionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   =\n Bills  , Reserve DT Updated 09/30/01  Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunda=\ny's game against Pittsburgh in the third quarter with an apparent wrist inj=\nury. He walked off the field and into the locker room to be examined, and h=\nis return is questionable.    Ricky Proehl  , Reserve WR Updated 08/19/01  =\nProehl has been dealing with a slight hamstring injury in recent days, acco=\nrding to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . The injury isn't considered serious,=\n however, and Proehl is expected to be ready for the start of the regular s=\neason.    Adam Vinatieri  , Reserve K Updated 12/13/00  Vinatieri has been =\none of the league's most accurate placekickers in recent weeks, converting =\non 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his chances against=\n the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense struggles like it did=\n on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's elite kickers on your=\n roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 20=\n01 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

THIS  IS  AMERICA!\nDate: Mon, 22 Oct 2001 08:34:28 -0500\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nX-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.5.2653.19)\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative;\tboundary=\"----_=_NextPart_001_01C15AFE.46297680\"\n\n\n \nHELLO!  THIS  IS  AMERICA! \n \nBroken Arrow, Oklahoma School officials remove \"God Bless America\" signs from\nschools in fear that someone might be offended. \n  \nChannel 12 News in Long Island, New York, orders flags removed from the\nnewsroom and red, white, and blue ribbons removed from the lapels of reporters.\n \n \nWhy? \n \nManagement did not want to appear biased and felt that our nations flag might\ngive the appearance that \"they lean one way or another\". \n  \nBerkeley, California bans U.S. Flags from being displayed on city fire trucks\nbecause they didn't want to offend anyone in the community. \n  \nIn an \"act of tolerance\" the head of the public library at Florida Gulf Coast\nUniversity ordered all \"Proud to be an American\" signs removed so as to not\noffend international students. \n  \nI, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of so-called American citizens;\nand I am tired of this nation worrying about whether or not we are offending\nsome individual or their culture. \n \nSince the terrorist attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge in\npatriotism by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had\nbarely settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the \"politically correct\"\ncrowd began complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was offending\nothers. \n  \nI am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is\nseeking a better life by coming to America.  \n \nIn fact, our country's population is almost entirely comprised of descendants\nof immigrants; however, there are a few things that those who have recently\ncome to our country, and apparently some native Americans, need to understand. \n  \nFirst of all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to offend you\nin any way.  This idea of America being a multi-cultural community has served\nony to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.  \n \nAs Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language, and\nour own lifestyle. \n \nThis culture, called the \"American Way\" has been developed over centuries of\nstruggles, trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have sought\nfreedom. \n \nOur forefathers fought, bled, and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam,\nSan Juan, Iwo Jima, Normandy, Korea, Vietnam, \n  \nWe speak English, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other\nlanguage. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society - learn our\nlanguage! \n \n\"In God We Trust\" is our national motto. \n \nThis is not some off-the-wall, Christian, Right Wing, political slogan;  it is\nour national motto. \n \nIt is engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it\nis printed on our currency. \n \nWe adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles,\nfounded this nation; and this is clearly documented throughout our history. \n \nIf it is appropriate for our motto to be inscribed in the halls of our highest\nlevel of Government, then it is certainly appropriate to display it on the\nwalls of our schools. \n  \nGod is in our pledge, our National Anthem, nearly every patriotic song, and in\nour founding documents.  We honor His birth, death, and resurrection as\nholidays, and we turn to Him in prayer in times of crisis. \n \nIf God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as\nyour new home, because God is part of our culture and we are proud to have Him.\n  \nWe are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our\nfreedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and Flag\nDay.  \n \nWe have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave our flag. \n \nAs an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my national anthem,\nquote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever and wherever I choose. \n \nIf the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle Sam, then you\nshould seriously consider a move to another part of this planet. \n  \nThe American culture is our way of life, our heritage, and we are proud of it. \nWe are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really don't\ncare how you did things where you came from, if it was so superior, go home. \n \nWe are Americans, like it or not, this is our country, our land, and our\nlifestyle. \n  \nOur First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion about\nour government, culture, or society, and we will allow you every opportunity to\ndo so. \n \nBut once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about our flag, our\npledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly encourage you take\nadvantage of one other great American freedom, the right to leave. \n \n \nIf you agree, pass this on to other Americans!! \nIt is time to take a stand!! \n \nMAY GOD BLESS AMERICA LAND THAT WE LOVE!!!\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake a great connection at Yahoo!

{"text": "\nEarlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.\n \nWe are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.\n \nIf you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.\n \nThank you for your support.\n \nEnron Global Technology\n \n \n \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration \nSent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM \nTo: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON \nCc: \nSubject: Supported Internet Email Addresses\n\n\n\nEnron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.\n\nAny new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.\n\nTo determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.\n\nIMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.\n\nWe will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.\n\nThank you for participation, cooperation and support. \n\nEnron Messaging Administration"}

He was=\n our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played=\n well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again.\" If =\nyou have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on yo=\nur team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander =\ndown t! he! stretch.Trent Dilfer, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Dilfe=\nr was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the s=\ntarting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters =\nat this point.Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated =\n10/23/01Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's =\ngame against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replace=\ns Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pull=\ned groin. This isn't a very favorable matc! hu! p for Hasselbeck from a Fan=\ntasy perspective, so don't use him this week.Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - South =\nPark Cows Updated 10/23/01The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for =\nnext Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine=\n the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.Dedric Wa=\nrd, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Ward missed Monday's practice due t=\no a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't=\n a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.Lamar Smith, RB MIA - =\nBeer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle=\n injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid=\n to use him this week.Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01Ch=\niefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of C=\nhris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you=\n use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly i=\nmposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.Jerome=\n P! at! hon, WR IND - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Pathon might miss=\n his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right fo=\not. Don't use him this week.Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Beer Gut Boys Update=\nd 10/23/01Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to=\n broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.=\nTerrell Davis, RB DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01Davis is=\n still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game fro=\nm arthroscopic knee s! ur! gery, but the Broncos have not decided whether t=\nhey will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos h=\nope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use=\n Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's sta=\nrting running back and is 100 percent healthy. Warrick Dunn, RB TB - Team T=\n-Bone Updated 10/23/01According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't h=\nave a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice unt=\nil late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against =\nMinnesota. Duce Staley, RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01Staley started =\nMonday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carr=\nied the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the gam=\ne by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on ! 11! carries late i=\nn the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consisten=\nt Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a so=\nlid replacement. Joe Nedney, K TEN - CYSWC Updated 10/23/01Nedney suffered =\na neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. Erron Kin=\nney, TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01Kinney will be listed on the injur=\ny report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this =\nweek's game. Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01Dyson is=\n recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game ag=\nainst the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.Eddie George,=\n RB TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01George suffered a thumb injury in=\n Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. Steve McNair, Q=\nB TEN - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01McNair is suffering from a sore ankle a=\ns a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in t=\nhis week's game. Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01The Te=\nnnessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve r=\neceiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consis=\nt of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime s=\noon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. Damon Jones, TE JAC - Fr=\nee Agent Updated 10/23/01Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesda=\ny. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.=\n Fred Taylor, RB JAC - High! S! hrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Taylor has be=\nen ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next wee=\nk's game remains uncertain. \"All I know is that, from week to week, they in=\ncrease his exercises and change of direction,\" head coach Tom Coughlin told=\n The Florida Times-Union. \"It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to =\nplay. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can =\nmake some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week.\" Taylor=\n has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.   Dennis N=\northcutt, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01Northcutt left Sunday's game =\nbecause of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to a=\nction next week. Todd Heap, TE BAL - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01Heap did n=\not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is op=\ntimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inact=\nive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. Terry Allen, RB BA=\nL - The Replacements Updated 10/23/01Allen, who left after the fifth play o=\nf Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game=\n. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. Elvis Grb=\nac, QB BAL! -! South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01Coach Brian Billick expects =\nGrbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterba=\nck wasn't so sure. \"I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest ar=\nea,\" Grbac said Monday. \"There could be something going on with the cartila=\nge. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait=\n and see.\" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  =\n Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01Hakim suffere=\nd a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However=\n, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orlean=\ns. Trung Canidate, RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/23/01 According to t=\nhe St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marsh=\nall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. \"I wouldn't expect Marshall to =\nbe up for this game,\" coach Mike Martz said. \"He's got to be 100 percent be=\nfore I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, =\nthen he doesn't play.\" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last=\n Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective=\n again this week.   J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/2=\n3/01Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is c=\nlose to being completely healthy. \"Thankfully the bye week came so early. I=\nt was a blessing f! or! me because I was able to get treatment every day,\" =\nStokes told the Contra Costa Times . \"I practiced today good. I wouldn't sa=\ny I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close.\" Stokes has been less than mediocre, =\nhowever, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to =\nbe more reliable. Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/0=\n1Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' st=\narting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Mond=\nay night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired=\n foot is almost completely healed. Ron Dixon, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 1=\n0/23/01Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due=\n to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. Marshall Faulk, RB=\n STL - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01According to Head Coach Mike Mart=\nz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. \"I'm just t=\naking the same posture that we did a week ago,\" Martz said. \"I would not ex=\npect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent b=\nefore I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play.\" Trung Canidate wou=\nld once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

{"text": "\nThe KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.\n\nThe following guidelines must be followed:\n?\tPlants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.\n?\tOnly potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. \n?\tEmployees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  \n?\tSecurity will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. \n?\tPayment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    \n\nIf you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522."}

Howev=\ner, coach Marty Mornhinweg stated that Stewart is making progress, and is g=\netting closer to returning to action.   Marco Battaglia , TE CIN  Updated 1=\n1/18/01 Battaglia (appendectomy) is out at least a month, and may miss the =\nrest of the season. The big tight end has no real value as a Fantasy player=\n.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC  Updated 11/18/01 Brunell (quadriceps) will start=\n on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be facing a tough Steelers' secondary =\nat less than 100 percent, however, so Fantasy owners may want to consider b=\nenching him in Week 10.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC  Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (gr=\noin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs medical clear=\nance before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Even is he is =\nable to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis. Stacey Mack wi=\nll get the start in any event, so playing Taylor on your Fantasy team is no=\nt a wise move. !   Jerome Pathon , WR IND  Updated 11/18/01 Pathon (foot) i=\ns out for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to the Indianapolis =\nStar. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place once again.   James Jackson=\n , RB CLE  Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) will likely be a gametime decis=\non on Sunday against Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unable to play, J=\namel White will be Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay getting some=\n looks in the backfield as well.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI  Updated 11/=\n17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas.=\n He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell=\n will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL  Updated =\n11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four =\ngames. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will n=\not be allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or =\nuntil Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL i=\nn Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) i=\ns out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again b=\ne Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations=\n.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN  Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports,=\n Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That=\n makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  St! ev! e McNair , QB=\n TEN  Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's ga=\nme against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball duri=\nng individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely =\nto play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week =\nas a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL  Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to =\nthe lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprai=\nned right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice =\nthat Smith would \"be ready to play the majority of the game.\" His return bu=\nmps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either bac=\nk against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI  Updated =\n11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday a=\nnd is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  Howeve=\nr, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this wee=\nk, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth conside=\nring as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 11/16/=\n01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback =\nfor Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting o=\nn your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Culpeppe=\nr is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in =\nMinnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the=\n league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup o=\nn a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers=\n may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider=\n benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should hav=\ne a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Mon=\nday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probab=\nle for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's b=\neen underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him bas=\ned on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO=\n  Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the leagu=\ne, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapoli=\ns defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a mu=\nst-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO  Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game =\nagainst San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. =\nHe may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge nu=\nmbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianap=\nol! is! defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO  Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up=\n a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167=\n yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vuln=\nerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid opt=\nion.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his pl=\nay after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over =\nhis last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy playe=\nr. Give him the start in Week 10 against a De! nv! er defense that is vulne=\nrable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Banks =\nhas played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. =\nHe's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beat=\nen through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy le=\nagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been in=\nconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his las=\nt four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable=\n at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gar=\ndner , WR WAS  Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last =\ntwo games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorabl=\ne matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good m=\nove.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsi! st=\n! ent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unl=\ness the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary=\n in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , =\nWR STL  Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals=\n, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a toug=\nh New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your=\n Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce=\n , WR STL  Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals thi=\ns season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll fa=\nce CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth=\n starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL=\n  Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he =\nis still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every wee=\nk, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Co=\nnwell , TE STL  Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had! a! few down weeks, so sta=\nrting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of de=\npth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something =\nmany Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB C=\nAR  Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend agains=\nt San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goin=\ngs. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   More Update=\ns  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Player Updates Scouting Reports  [IMAGE]'); [IMAGE]  Latest NFL=\n Player News  Todd Heap , TE BAL  Updated 10/18/01 Heap practiced Wednesday=\n but remains questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland. Reserve Heap on y=\nour roster this week. It would be wise to keep him inactive until he is eff=\nective in a game.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF  Updated 10/18/01 According to publ=\nished reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a football until t=\nhe Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealing with a sore t=\nhrowing elbow, as well as a few other ! na! gging bumps and bruises. Howeve=\nr, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 against =\nChicago.   Peerless Price , WR BUF  Updated 10/18/01 Price might post respe=\nctable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin becaus=\ne of injuries.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF  Updated 10/18/01 Moulds might get in =\nthe end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around of=\nten against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.  Larry Centers , RB BUF  =\nUpdated 10/18/0!  Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far,=\n but that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to at=\ntack an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price a=\nnd TE Jay Riemersma.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE  Updated 10/18/01 There's a very=\n slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this w=\neek .     Bledsoe was upgraded from \"out\" to \"doubtful\" on the injury repor=\nt, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit.=\n He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the b=\nall if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined.   Bledsoe's p=\nrogress has been slower than he hoped and there's no timetable for his retu=\nrn.      Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK  Updated 10/18/01 Wheatley won't practice =\nduring the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of=\n an injured right knee.          \"Tyrone Wheatley has a second degree - I d=\non't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,\"' coach Jon Gruden said =\nWednesday.   Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at Ph=\niladelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progre=\nssed.   He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks.   \"I wou=\nld not agree with that at this time,\" Gruden said.     Chris Weinke , QB CA=\nR  Updated 10/18/01 Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain wh=\nether he will play in ! Wa! shington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. T=\nhe injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Mo=\nnday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wedn=\nesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Damey=\nune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.   Brian Griese , QB DEN  Updat=\ned 10/18/01 Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and he's c=\nonfident he'll play Sunday against San Diego.   Griese complained of should=\ner soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The probl=\nem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawk=\ns defensive end Lamar King.   Tests Monday showed no structural damage to h=\nis shoulder.     Redskins , DT WAS  Updated 10/17/01 Cornerback Champ Baile=\ny missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected! =\nt! o play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing thi=\ns weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if =\nhe's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI  Updated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring)=\n is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't bee=\nn full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised if his status is d=\nowngraded over the next two days.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR  Updated 10/17=\n/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready t=\no play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to s=\ntart from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR  Updated 10/17/=\n01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's =\ngame against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he =\nmay be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week,=\n Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at all possible. =\n  Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesd=\nay due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the ro=\nokie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quart=\nerback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defen=\nse.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL  Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returned to p=\nractice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans=\n, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective=\n.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL  Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to =\npractice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunda=\ny against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan =\nLeaf , QB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense d! u=\nr! ing practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was=\n given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chanc=\ne to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at th=\nis time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL  Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas =\nis gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullb=\nack. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy =\nplayer is still minimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN  Updated =\n10/17/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay =\ndue to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Tra=\nvis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Mos=\ns , WR MIN  Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's ga=\nme against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you =\nto start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for u=\nnless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI  =\nUpdated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his=\n old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terrell =\nDavis , RB DEN  Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Davis woul=\nd like to return to the lineup Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a=\n knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by N=\november 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this develo=\npment also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back. =\n Stacey Mack , RB JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of carries this=\n week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on=\n nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC  Update=\nd 10/17/01  McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, bu=\nt looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play=\n well this week and catch a lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC  Update=\nd 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He wil=\nl catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mar=\nk Brunell , QB JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by=\n headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for o=\nver 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Brady =\nis expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed=\n as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has fi=\nve catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC  Updated 10/17/01 Smith has =\nbeen very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and =\nscore a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET  Updated 10/17/01=\n Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his =\nhip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. \"We're disappointed the injury is mu=\nch worse than we thought,\" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. \"We beli=\neved it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the musc=\nle.\" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team. Larry Foster assumes the No=\n. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK  Updated 10/17/01 Ac=\ncording to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a=\n right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charl=\nie Garner before he was hurt.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commis=\nsioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

KEEP THE ALGEBRAIC MEAN SEQUENCED DRAFT ORDER.   \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Kiske, Chris  [mailto:Chris.Kiske@arbitron.com]\nSent: Wednesday, September 05,  2001 9:59 PM\nTo: 'Kevin'; Ty Servello; Mike Deluke; Michael Currie;  Jody Spottswood; Jeff Ullrich; Jeff Smith (E-mail); Grant Johnson; Dutch  Quigley; Dan Wienserski; Chris Kiske (Home); BJ Naman; Andy Reynolds; Kiske,  Chris\nSubject: RE: Franchise Players and the  Draft\nAs  the creator of the algebraic mean sequenced draft order that was built to  eliminate the inherent advantage that the #1 & #14 teams had by getting  back to back picks every other round, I think the time for mathematical  preciseness has passed.  I'm all for going to a simplified traditional  snake system.  Frankly, at this point I think there are as many  disadvantages to being 1 or 14 (or 2 - 13) as advantages that it all works  itself out.  Hell, if it makes preparing for the draft any easier (or  administering the league), I'm for it!\n \nPS -  I'm for keeping TE's too!\n \n(Somewhere, Rick is rolling over in his  grave)\n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Kevin  [mailto:klyn@pdq.net]\nSent: Wednesday, September 05, 2001 5:53  PM\nTo: Ty Servello; Mike Deluke; Michael Currie; Jody Spottswood;  Jeff Ullrich; Jeff Smith (E-mail); Grant Johnson; Dutch Quigley; Dan  Wienserski; Chris Kiske (Home); BJ Naman; Andy Reynolds; Chris Kiske  (Work)\nSubject: Franchise Players and the  Draft\nThe following is the list of franchise players  that have been kept:\n \nGrant Johnson - Eddie George\nJeff Smith - Peyton Manning\nMichael Deluke - Marshall Faulk\nMichael Currie - Edgerrian James\nJeff Ullrich - Kurt Warner\n \nI know this was brought up last year and we  kind of decided much of nothing...but does anyone object to going to a snake  system for the draft.  1-14, 14-1 for the whole draft?  We will  still have a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise  players.  Then the non-franchise teams will pick in opposite order of  the supplemental round for round one...thus if you pick first in the  supplemental round, you will pick last (for those that did not keep  franchise players) in the first round.  Then, the teams that kept  franchise players will be randomly selected to pick at the end of the first  round.  After the first round, the draft will snake back the other way  with the last pick in the first round getting the first pick in the second  round and the draft will continue in this snake order until the end of the  draft.  Let me know what you think or if you are confused.\n \nSee everyone at the draft!!! \n \nKevin\n "}

He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander)=\n has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play,=\n he'll play again.\" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to=\n stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the j=\nob back from Alexander down! t! he stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free A=\ngent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groi=\nn injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't=\n be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Pumpd=\nog Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback f=\nor Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer=\n. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined=\n with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbec! k =\n! from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , =\nWR NYJ - Baby Blues Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questi=\nonable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday t=\no determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Ram=\ns.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's=\n practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Sea=\nttle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar=\n Smith , RB MIA - Xtreme Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due=\n to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don=\n't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Cali Bound Upda=\nted 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might s=\ntart ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don'=\nt recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' second=\nary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter t=\nhis week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Xtreme Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might mi=\nss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right =\nfoot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Upda=\nted 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due=\n to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this we=\nek.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Cali Bound Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still ta=\nrgeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthros=\ncopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will a! c=\nt! ivate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to kn=\now by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in=\n a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting run=\nning back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Third World =\nCountryman Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doe=\nsn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practi=\nce until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday ag=\nainst Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - KMB Express Updated 10/23/01 Stal=\ney started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. =\nStaley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late=\n in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gaine! d ! 34 yards on 11 ca=\nrries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to po=\nst consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster all=\nows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/2=\n3/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play=\n this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Baby Blues Updated 10/23/01 Kinney wi=\nll be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is =\nexpected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - She Said Upd=\nated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to pl=\nay in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in =\npractice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/23/01 Georg=\ne suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this =\nweek's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 McNair i=\ns suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. Howev=\ner, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN - =\nFree Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc =\nproblem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist t=\nhis week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don'=\nt expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his=\n absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is exp=\nected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that=\n his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor! , RB JAC - She Said U=\npdated 10/23/01Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore=\n and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. \"All I know is that=\n, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,\" =\nhead coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. \"It remains to be see=\nn when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds =\nwell this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a ret=\nurn date] next week.\" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his =\ngroin on Sept 23.    Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/0=\n1 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to p=\nlay when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free=\n Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billi=\nck told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in thi=\ns week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a =\nsprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - She Said Updated 10/23/01 Allen, w=\nho left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is que=\nstionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back i=\nf Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - The ! Le! ather Cheerios Upda=\nted 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's gam=\ne against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. \"I'm day-to-day=\n. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,\" Grbac said Monday. \"There cou=\nld be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or =\nthrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see.\" Randall Cunningham will=\n replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Xtrem=\ne Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win=\n over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this w=\neekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - 2700 HUEVOS =\nUpdated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expe=\ncted to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. =\n\"I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,\" coach Mike Martz said.=\n \"He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to =\nlet him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play.\" Canidate proved himse=\nlf as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be star=\nting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - =\nKMB Express Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to h=\nis injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. \"Thankfully the =\nbye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because! I! was able to ge=\nt treatment every day,\" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . \"I practiced t=\noday good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close.\" Stokes has b=\neen less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unle=\nss he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - KMB Exp=\nress Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now b=\nack in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches=\n for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though hi=\ns surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NY=\nG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to t=\nhe Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-=\nto-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Baby Blues Updated 10/23/01 According t=\no Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against Ne=\nw Orleans. \"I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,\" Martz=\n said. \"I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's g=\not to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him pla=\ny.\" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable=\n to go.

He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Col=\nts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leavin=\ng the game.    Derrick Alexander  , WR KC - CYSWC Updated 10/25/01   Alexan=\nder suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapoli=\ns.

Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated=\n 10/25/01   Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Mon=\nday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a =\nthird receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if h=\ne is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 10/25/01  =\n Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, =\nbut head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making pro=\ngress.

{"text": "Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.\n\nTo emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.\n\nThe Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.\n\nI truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.\n\nDuring my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.\n\nThank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.\n\nKen Lay"}

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett m=\nay be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - The Leather C=\nheerios Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expecte=\nd to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky =\nstart from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - She Said Updated=\n 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Ci=\nncinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual=\n drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despi=\nte not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result. =\n Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/16/01 Smith will re=\nturn to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with=\n a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's p=\nractice that Smith would \"be ready to play the majority of the game.\" His r=\neturn bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use ei=\nther back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI -=\n Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injur=\ny report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game agai=\nnst Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a la=\nrger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit second=\nary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.   ! Chris Weinke , Q=\nB CAR - KMB Express Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke=\n will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. =\nHowever, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper ,=\n QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy=\n season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season.=\n He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspecti=\nve, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter =\n, WR MIN - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down =\nsomewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. Th=\ne veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game=\n against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   =\nRandy Moss , WR MIN - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probabl=\ne for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's be=\nen underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him base=\nd on his potential to! p! ost solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB =\nNO - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fan=\ntasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He=\n'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season lo=\nng, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Third World Cou=\nntryman Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last w=\neekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent=\n this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to benc=\nh him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jack=\nson , WR NO - Third World Countryman Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge=\n game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards =\nreceiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable =\nto the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   =\nStephen Davis , RB WAS - 2700 ! HU! EVOS Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped=\n up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rus=\nhing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fan=\ntasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is=\n vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updat=\ned 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his =\nlast three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver tea=\nm that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in ve=\nry deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World Country=\nman Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he ha=\ns caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver=\n secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deep=\ner leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Baby Blues Update=\nd 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching o=\nnly three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weeken=\nd against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. !   Az-Zahir Hak=\nim , WR STL - Xtreme Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent=\n weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup=\n is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, s=\no avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Pumpdo=\ng Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but =\nhe's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New =\nEngland secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fanta=\nsy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR =\nSTL - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy tota=\nls this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He=\n'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still=\n worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , =\nRB STL - Baby Blues Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina=\n, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a mu=\nst-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New E=\nngland.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Xtreme Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had =\na few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gam=\nble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starti=\nng Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. =\n  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Baby Blues ! Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be =\nthe likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surpris=\ned if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Wee=\nk 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16=\n/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis.=\n He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a =\nreal gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Walls h=\nas! b! een held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of t=\nhe better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Franc=\nisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR =\n- KMB Express Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive g=\name, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some succ=\ness in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting hi=\nm is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Cali Bound Updated 11/16/01 Fav=\nre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season.=\n He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so =\nbe sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Hillrods Upd=\nated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven tou=\nchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have=\n a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that shoul=\nd start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Baby Blues Updated 1=\n1/16/01 S! ch! roeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and i=\ns expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week =\nagainst Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like=\n Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Drough=\nns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this we=\nekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outsi=\nde of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren ,=\n RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of =\nthe injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries wit=\nh Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fa=\nntasy leagues.

However, the wide receiver =\nhas no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS =\n- Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will star=\nt Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last=\n weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effect! s ! of the injur=\ny and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Bark=\ning Spiders Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to pract=\nice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and =\nis best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Water=\n Boys Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during=\n the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries=\n aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the sta=\nrting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent U=\npdated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game aga=\ninst Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in =\nthis weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fanta=\nsy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - The Replacements Updated 11/2=\n0/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-r=\nepaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fa=\nct, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cri=\ns Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on =\na bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the=\n rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - South Park Cows Updated 11/20=\n/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replac=\ned as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to st=\nart for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/=\n20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss =\nThursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a=\n Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Addison Red Cornholes U=\npdated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the sea=\nson after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack o=\nutput of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passin=\ng yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/20/01=\n Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a spr=\nained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just =\none game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect =\nhis presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmi=\ntt Smith , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start=\n on Thursday's game against Denver. \"I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy e=\nnough to do my job,\" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star . He'll struggle to=\n post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench hi=\nm this week if at all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Water Boys Upda=\nted 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San F=\nrancisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to pl=\nay this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst =\nin the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   T=\nerry Hardy , TE ARI - South Park Cows Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expect! e! =\nd to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder=\n injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.   =\nJackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thur=\nsday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an un=\nreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues. =\n  James Stewart , RB DET - South Park Cows Updated 11/20/01 Stewart (ankle)=\n is hopeful that he can play returned to practice and may start Thursday's =\ngame against Green Bay. He will work his ankle extensively in practice prio=\nr to Thursday, and is optimistic that he'll be ready to play. If Stewart is=\n able to go, he's worth starting in if you need a running back for Week 11.=\n     Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/20/01 Taylor has =\nbeen told by a medical specialist that he should not return to action this =\nweekend against Pittsburgh. In fact, Taylor could be out for an even longer=\n period of time than what was originally diagnosed. Taylor tore the groin m=\nuscle completely off the bone back in Week Two, which is an injury that nor=\nmally takes about three months to heal. \"It's going to be very unfair for !=\n an! yone to assume he will play any time in the immediate future,\" said Ta=\nylor's agent, Drew Rosenhaus. \"He's just not healthy yet. He can't run full=\n speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a very good job in wo=\nrking him but he's still in pain.\" Expect Stacey Mack and Elvis Joseph to c=\nontinue splitting carries in Taylor's absence.    Bert Emanuel , WR DET - F=\nree Agent Updated 11/20/01 Emanuel is out for Thursday's game against Green=\n Bay due to a sprained ankle. In fact, the injury is so bad that Emanuel ma=\ny miss the remiander of the season, but no definitive word on his condition=\n has been made by the team.  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Dallas Demon Horde =\nUpdated 11/20/01 According to published reports, Muhammad's shoulder injury=\n will likely keep him out of Sunday's game against Atlanta. That could mean=\n big things for Donald Hayes and Issac Bryd, who'll start against a questio=\nnable Falcons secondary.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Team T-Bone Updated 1=\n1/20/01 Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'l=\nl likely be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last =\nweek against Indianpolis.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/=\n20/01 According to the Dallas Morning News, Carter expects to start on Dec.=\n 2 against Washington. Carter, who has been out since October with a hamstr=\ning injury, will serve as the No. 3 quarterback on Thursday vs. Denver.   I=\nke Hilliard , WR NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/19/01 Hilliard continu=\nes to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe, and it is causing =\nhim to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start in Monday's game ag=\nainst Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his i=\nnjury.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to p=\nublished reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action thi=\ns weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however=\n, so don't bother starting him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - CYSWC Up=\ndated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win=\n over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is ex=\npected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNair , QB=\n TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury =\nto his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some prac=\ntice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next gam=\ne.   Packers , DT GB - South Park Cows Updated 11/19/01 Safety LeRoy Butler=\n suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atla=\nnta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chr=\nis Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence.   S=\nteve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play=\n with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probabl=\ny miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the=\n team's next game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 1=\n1/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. =\nX-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day.   Reggie Wayne , W=\nR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunda=\ny. His current status is day to day.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Aryan Brother In=\nc. Updated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His statu=\ns for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL -=\n High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of th=\ne season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered=\n a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weeke=\nnd's contest at Carolina.

He was already playing with a =\nsore right hip that limited him in practice last week. \"I will get an MRI i=\nn the morning and go from there,\" Johnson said. \"Right now, they are saying=\n that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could no=\nt have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.\"   Emmitt Smi=\nth, RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01Smith pronounced himself O=\nK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 vict=\nory over Arizona on Sunday. \"It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'l=\nl be all right,\" Smith said. \"I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know =\nthe degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.\"   But Smith was able to wa=\nlk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week a=\nt the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on=\n Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    Daunt=\ne Culpepper , QB MIN - Pumpdog Updated 10/28/01 According to published repo=\nrts, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. H=\ne is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Pumpd=\nog Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New Engla=\nnd, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  sta=\ntistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB=\n DEN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14=\n carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard! r! un, but th=\ne Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denve=\nr appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten=\n , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yar=\nds and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as=\n he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - T=\nhe Hillrods Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD=\n at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will alwa=\nys be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots'=\n schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/28/01 Conw=\nay caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway wa=\ns a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying =\nhealthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideo=\nut.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - She Said Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a spr=\nained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards=\n. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much=\n of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideou=\nts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Ce=\nnters , RB BUF - The Leather Cheerios Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited =\nto eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally wa=\nnt to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't =\nexpect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless ! Pr! ice  , WR BUF =\n- Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 ya=\nrds and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to=\n have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hassel=\nbeck , QB SEA - Pumpdog Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a =\npro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued=\n to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield=\n on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Leather Cheerios Updat=\ned 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consider=\ning the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked res=\npectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post g=\nood yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overa=\nll output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - She Said Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden cau=\nght only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not pla=\nying well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight=\n , WR MIA - Baby B! lu! es Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes fo=\nr 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver =\ncontinues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - =\nCali Bound Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carrie=\ns by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should=\n not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - The L=\neather Cheerios Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes fo! r ! 109 yard=\ns and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no m=\natter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - 2700 HUEVOS Updated=\n 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out o=\nf the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskin=\ns continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony=\n Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, tw=\no TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is p=\nlaying well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI -=\n KMB Express Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was =\nheld to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 =\nyards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should po=\nst better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buck=\nhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back =\nis the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Ga=\nrner , RB OAK - Baby Blues Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 y=\nards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firm=\nly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sid=\nelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01 Gannon=\n passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's =\ngame at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' seconda=\nry, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Do! n=\no! van McNabb  , QB PHI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for ju=\nst 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get in=\ntercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against t=\nhe Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bi=\nt of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fanta=\nsy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB AR=\nI - Cali Bound Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards S=\nunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, =\nand we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the =\nremainder of the year. David Boston , WR ARI - The Hillrods Updated 10/28/0=\n1 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While=\n Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspecti=\nve, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in =\nthe Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  =\nJake Plummer , QB ARI - She Said Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 ya=\nrds, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, furthe=\nr exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherw=\nise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboy=\ns , DT DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Card=\ninals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions =\nin the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspe=\nctive based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into be=\nlieving that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.=\n  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed =\n9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushin=\ng for seven times for 23 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona=\n. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a=\n weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based=\n on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 10/28=\n/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter wit=\nh a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He=\n will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Cali Bound Updated 10/2=\n8/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee =\ninjury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was bri=\nefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

{"text": "\nI don't see the need to mix franchise and non-franchise on the first round.\nWe're trying to get less confusing - not more.  What we do not need is some\nmajor change in the draft methodology 2 days before the draft.\n\nThe system that Kevin initially described is the fairest, least confusing\nand works fine.  The franchise keepers (including me) should pick after\nthose that do not keep anyone.    It best simulates the outcome of a\nnon-franchise snake draft.  Assuming the franchise keepers retain picks 1\nthrough 5 of  a true first round, they would naturally pick last in a\nsecond round.  This system worked fine last year.\n\nDutch and Jeff have brought up ranking the franchise players instead of a\n2nd random drawing for franchise keepers.  I would vote for that (even\nthough I would pick last in the 1st round - 28th pick!).  There are\nquestions with players that might have been injured part of the year or\notherwise, but at least you know exactly where you stand.\n\nI believe in using the snake draft and a 2nd drawing for franchise keepers,\nbut I would be fine with ranking the franchise players based on prior year.\n\nJeff Smith is just whining because he kept (potentially) the 10th overall\nplayer in Manning and would now potentially has Manning and the 28th pick.\nThis is a large sacrifice, but this is Jeff's fault not the system.  Look\nat the other 4 franchise players - they are all in the top 5 in most draft\nrankings.

You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy =\nplayers just like yourself!   =09\n\n\n  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=\n start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te=\nrry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =\nStaley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=\nr - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start agai=\nnst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=\nnd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=\n not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have t=\no go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =\ngoing with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=\nnswer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=\nina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but=\n Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=\n best, so our hands are tied.  =09\n\n\n  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=\nis week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=\ne. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=\nent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be =\nfacing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=\n like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=\nig game.  =09\n\n\n  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shan=\nnon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=\nohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=\nailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target i=\nn the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=\nrpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=\nghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =\ncurrent pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not =\ngood enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=\n will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=\nother No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=\nntasy player.  =09\n\n\n    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start =\ngiving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=\nn the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=\nfter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=\n will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09\n\n\n  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the \"Gridiron Guru.\"   \t[IMAGE]\tInside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   \t\n\n\n [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \t\n\n\n    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  \t\n\n\n    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  \t\n\n\n    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t\n\n\n  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  \t\n\n\n  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  \t\n\n\n  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  \t\n\n\n    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.  \t\n\n\n  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

Considering the =\nstate of the Redskins' defense, we'd suggest starting Muhammad despite his =\ninjury.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR  Updated 10/19/01 Weinke missed a portion o=\nf practice on Thursday due to a thigh bruise. However, Head Coach Geroge Se=\nifert expects his rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington.=\n The matchup ! ag! ainst the 'Skins is a good one for Weinke, who should re=\nceive starting consideration from Fantasy owners.   Rob Moore , WR ARI  Upd=\nated 10/19/01 Moore (hamstring) missed practice on Thursday and has been do=\nwngraded for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He'll likely miss yet anoth=\ner week of action, so keep him on reserve if he's currently on your roster.=\n   Steve McNair , QB TEN  Updated 10/19/01 McNair is listed as questionable=\n (shoulder) for Sunday's game against the Lions but is expected to play. Lo=\nok for him to score a touchdown by either running the ball in or throwing. =\n  Eddie George  , RB TEN  Updated 10/19/01 George is listed as questionable=\n on the injury report with an ankle injury but is expected to play Sunday a=\ngainst Detroit. Look for George to have a big game against the struggling L=\nions.   Travis Taylor , WR BAL  Updated 10/19/01 Look for Taylor to catch s=\neveral passes this week and snag at least one touchdown pass. He has become=\n one of Elvis Grbac's favorite targets inside the red zone.   Qadry Ismail =\n, WR BAL  Updated 10/19/01 Ismail will catc! h ! a few passes this week but=\n don't expect him to score any touchdowns. He has just two TD receptions in=\n five games.   Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE  Updated 10/19/01 Northcutt has be=\nen getting a lot of practice in the No. 2 receiver slot and might fill-in f=\nor the injured Quincy Morgan as a starter. Don't expect Northcutt to be too=\n productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout.    Tre=\nnt Green , QB KC  Updated 10/18/01 The Chiefs might depend on the run, so G=\nreen's numbers may be limited. Expect one TD pass, but his yardage numbers =\nwill be modest.  Ken Dilger , TE IND  Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a majo=\nr factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from h=\nim against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard , =\nTE IND  Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at =\ntight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against N=\new England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND  Updated 10/18/01 James was =\nheld to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this ye=\nar.! E! xpect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wa=\nyne , WR IND  Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in place of the i=\nnjured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done mu=\nch yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND =\n Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, an=\nd has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good num=\nbers against New England.  Pe! yt! on Manning , QB IND  Updated 10/18/01 Ma=\nnning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was inte=\nrcepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them=\n at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN  Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not par=\nticipate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be ab=\nle to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off =\ndeciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to =\nplay.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB  Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice W=\nedne! sd! ay with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should pla=\ny Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this =\nweek.   Terry Glenn , WR NE  Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good=\n game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn,=\n who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  =\nAntowain Smith , RB NE  Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two =\nTDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the e=\nnd zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  =\nWayne Chrebet , WR NYJ  Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very d=\nisappointing so far. He could have a good week if the Jets engage in a shoo=\ntout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center=\n its gameplan around Curtis Martin.  Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ  Updated 10/=\n18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held=\n down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his=\n downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ  Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be =\nthe focal point ! of! the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to =\ncontrol the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS  =\nUpdated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday ag=\nainst Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington'=\ns horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so=\n starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS  Up=\ndated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, comp=\nleting 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point,=\n Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael =\nWestbrook , WR WAS  Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre =\nthis season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had s=\nome success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth sta=\nrting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ  Updated 10/18/01 Test=\naverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be op=\nportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first intercept=\nion of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS  Updated 10/18/01! Rasby will likel=\ny get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen Alexander is out. Howe=\nver, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner=\n , WR WAS  Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a ques=\ntionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter =\nFantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL  Updated 10=\n/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets=\n secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your=\n! s! tarting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL  Updated 10/1=\n8/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented =\nto ever consider benching.

It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.\n\n?\tClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.\n?\tMatching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.\n\nWe regret that we have had to make these changes.

He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent =\nweeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents c=\nontinue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - High Shrivel Facto=\nr Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five pas=\nses for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remain! =\ns ! a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - =\nSouth Park Cows Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches f=\nor 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a mu=\nst-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and un=\nderrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - High Shrivel Fact=\nor Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonvill=\ne, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be=\n a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Money Sho=\nts Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against O=\nakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the se=\nason.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Barber ru=\nshed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 =\nyards. He has played well recently, ! al! though his owners would still lik=\ne to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD=\n - Barking Spiders Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone,=\n but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had=\n 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.  =\n Doug Flutie , QB SD - Water Boys Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game,=\n throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's o=\nnly worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage. !   Jake Plummer ,=\n QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday=\n, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also th=\nrew two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Bosto=\nn , WR ARI - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding=\n game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego.=\n He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is wort=\nh starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty=\n Mullets Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, ca=\ntching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most de=\npendable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Jo=\ne Horn , WR NO - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another so=\nlid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's bee=\nn a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a wee=\nkly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 11/25/01 In his r=\neturn from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards=\n. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley=\n does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near futur=\ne. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries a=\nway from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 S=\nmith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans.=\n After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty goo! d ! weekly option for F=\nantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/25/01 Brad=\ny put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and fo=\nur touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his perfor=\nmance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week=\n.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw =\nfor 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignore=\nd rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB i=\nn Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated=\n 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating=\n a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return =\nto the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Barking Spiders Updated 11/25/01 Mould=\ns finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards=\n and ! tw! o TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners s=\nhould still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the =\nyear. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a m=\nediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets U=\npdated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, thr=\nee TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy conside=\nration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden =\n, WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes =\nfor 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fu=\nmble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these im=\nportant final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/25/01=\n Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. Hi=\ns performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is sti=\nll too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI=\n - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held Mc! Na! bb to 9=\n2 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect =\nthe Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  Jame=\ns Thrash , WR PHI - Barking Spiders Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught four pas=\nses for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter=\n on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS -=\n Water Boys Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards o=\nn Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, an=\nd now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , =\nRB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday =\nas Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 y=\nards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis =\nhas always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free=\n Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place o! f ! the injured Muhsin Muh=\nammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, ca=\ntching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsi=\nn Muhammad , WR CAR - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed S=\nunday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next =\nweekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexa=\nnder , WR KC - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 ya=\nrds in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander m=\nay continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chan=\ndler , QB ATL - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday=\n, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack=\n Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor =\nFantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - CYSWC Updated 11/25/01 Alexa=\nnder caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a! r! ib injury. He =\nwas not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointme=\nnt if he stays healthy.

The Raiders plan to use him if Tyrone Wheatley is unable to play. Bu=\nt don't expect Kirby to get a lot of touches. Oakland will likely rely on C=\nharlie Garner instead.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK  Updated 10/26/01   Wh=\neatley missed practice again on Thursday because of wrist and knee injuries=\n. He remains questionable for Sunday's game. Terry Kirby will replace him i=\nn the rotation if he is unable to play.     Damon Jones  , TE JAC  Updated =\n10/26/01   Jones, recovering from a shoulder injury, returned to practice T=\nhursday. He might remains questionable for this week's game but might see s=\nome action.      Shannon Sharpe  , TE BAL  Updated 10/26/01   Sharpe has be=\nen downgraded on the injury report from probable to qyestionable. He has be=\nen limited in practice all week because of a leg injury. Rookie Todd Heap m=\night get a lot of looks on offense but he is also recovering from injury. T=\nhe Ravens may be forced to use tight end John Jones.     Terrence Wilkins  =\n, WR IND  Updated 10/26/01   Wilkins missed Thursday's game at Kansas City.=\n He was held out of the lineup because of broken ribs.      Jerome Pathon  =\n, WR IND  Updated 10/26/01   Pathon missed his third straight game Thursday=\n at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. He was replaced by rookie Reg=\ngie Wayne in the starting lineup.      Drew Bledsoe  , QB NE  Updated 10/26=\n/01   It doesn't appear that Bledsoe will be used as an emergency QB Sunday=\n, but The Boston Herald reports that doctors will make a decision on whethe=\nr on not to increase his workload. Bledsoe has thrown 75 passes in the past=\n two days without experiencing any adverse affects.     Elvis Joseph  , RB =\nJAC  Updated 10/26/01   Joseph might replace Stacey Mack as the starting ba=\nck this Sunday, according to The Florida Times-Union . Mack has made two cr=\nitical mistakes in the past two games. Joseph has been getting a lot of car=\nries this week and has already been slated to be the third-down back. We wo=\nuldn't advise using either player this week if you already have two solid b=\nacks.     Stacey Mack  , RB JAC  Updated 10/26/01   Mack might be replaced =\nin the starting lineup by rookie Elvis Joseph, according to The Florida Tim=\nes-Union . The Jaguars are reportedly looking to use Joseph because of the =\nmistakes Mack has made in the past two games. Consider reserving Mack this =\nweek.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL  Updated 10/26/01   Galloway was limited =\nin practice once again Thursday because of a foot injury. The Dallas Mornin=\ng News reports that he will be a gametime decision.     Reggie Swinton  , W=\nR DAL  Updated 10/26/01   Swinton practiced Thursday an is expected to play=\n Sunday, according to The Dallas Morning News . Swinton had been limited fo=\nr most of the week because of a hamstring injury.     Michael Bennett  , RB=\n MIN  Updated 10/26/01   Don't expect Bennett to return to the starting lin=\neup soon. He is listed as questionable on the injury report but probably wo=\nn't return until after the Vikings' bye in Week Eight.     Jacquez Green  ,=\n WR TB  Updated 10/26/01   Green was limited in practice Thursday because o=\nf a groin injury. He remains questionable for Sunday's game and will be re-=\nevaluated on Saturday.     Warrick Dunn  , RB TB  Updated 10/26/01   Dunn w=\nas limited in practice Thursday because of his hamstring injury and remains=\n questionable for Sunday's game. He will be re-evaluated on Saturday.     K=\neyshawn Johnson  , WR TB  Updated 10/26/01   Johnson was upgraded from ques=\ntionable to probable Thursday. He is suffering from hip and thigh injuries =\nbut was able to run for the second consecutive day. Johnson is expected to =\nplay in Sunday's game.      Hines Ward  , WR PIT  Updated 10/26/01   Ward (=\nankle) was limited in practice Thursday, according to The Pittsburgh Post-G=\nazette . He is still expected to play in Monday's game against Tennessee.  =\n   Terry Glenn  , WR NE  Updated 10/26/01   The Patriots will reportedly be=\nnch Glenn once again this week if he doesn't show any improvement in practi=\nce Friday. Glenn is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable f=\nor Sunday's game.      Rod Smith  , WR DEN  Updated 10/26/01   Smith is lis=\nted as probable on the injury report. He is suffering from an ankle injury =\nbut is expected to start Sunday's game against New England.     Chris Weink=\ne  , QB CAR  Updated 10/26/01   Weinke is suffering from a hip injury but i=\ns expected to start Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury r=\neport.     Shane Matthews  , QB CHI  Updated 10/26/01   Matthews is sufferi=\nng from sore ribs but is expected to be the No. 2 QB Sunday. He is listed a=\ns probable on the injury report.     Terry Allen  , RB BAL  Updated 10/26/0=\n1   Allen practiced Wednesday but was too sore to work out Thursday. He rem=\nains questionable for Sunday's game but The Washington Post claims that it =\nis almost certain Allen will be replaced by Jason Brookins.     Anthony Wri=\nght  , QB DAL  Updated 10/26/01   Not only is Wright out for the season, he=\n might need season-ending surgery to repair his damaged knee. An MRI showed=\n that he damaged the same ACL that was repaired in five years ago.     Mars=\nhall Faulk  , RB STL  Updated 10/26/01   Head coach Mike Martz has ruled Fa=\nulk out for Sunday's game, according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch . Faulk=\n is still recovering from a bruised knee so Trung Canidate will replace him=\n as the starting running back once again.     Terrell Davis  , RB DEN  Upda=\nted 10/26/01   Bothered by soreness in his lower left leg and five weeks re=\nmoved from surgery on his right knee, Davis practiced with the Broncos Thur=\nsday but remained questionable for Sunday's game against the New England Pa=\ntriots. \"Hopefully there's no setback today and he just keeps on getting be=\ntter and better,\" Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. \"I anticipate or I'm ho=\nping for the Monday night game [Nov. 5] there will be no setback this week,=\n and he'll be ready to go.\"  Shanahan did not rule Davis out for Sunday's g=\name, but a Nov. 5 return seems more likely. Even if Davis does play this Su=\nnday, Mike Anderson will probably get most of the carries.     Patrick Jeff=\ners  , WR CAR  Updated 10/26/01   Jeffers, who tore the anterior cruciate l=\nigament in his left knee during in a preseason game against the Pittsburgh =\nSteelers in 2000, said he's been told by the coaching staff that he'll be a=\nctivated Sunday for the first time this season. \"They said it looks like I'=\nll be up, so I'm preparing like I will be,\" Jeffers said. \"I'm excited. It'=\ns another step along the way.\" However, the Panthers may delay his return i=\nf injured receiver Steve Smith is able to play. Keep Jeffers reserved for n=\now. He will see limited action if plays.     Ryan Leaf  , QB DAL  Updated 1=\n0/26/01   Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has be=\nen named the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright.     Clint Stoe=\nrner  , QB DAL  Updated 10/26/01   Stoerner will start at quarterback for t=\nhe Dallas Cowboys against Arizona on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who =\nis out with a chronic sprained knee and could face season-ending surgery. W=\ne wouldn't advise using Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. =\nHe has played just three games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of=\n-7 for 44 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Lea=\nf will be the No. 2 quarterback for Dallas.     Edgerrin James  , RB IND  U=\npdated 10/26/01   James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter o=\nf Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Do=\nminic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remain=\ned on the sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine=\n for the Colts' next game on November 4.     Derrick Alexander  , WR KC  Up=\ndated 10/25/01   Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday=\n's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minn=\nis saw most of the work in two receiver sets.    James Hodgins  , RB STL  U=\npdated 10/25/01   Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionabl=\ne for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams =\noffense even if he is healthy.

This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken le=\ng on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Pump=\ndog Updated 11/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in th=\ne second half of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. H=\ne did not throw a touchdown pass for! t! he first time this season, however=\n, and has been very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper =\ncontinues to struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injur=\ny by Week 12.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 It is u=\nnclear who will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicag=\no, as Batch is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on T=\nhursday. Mike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch =\ncan't go, but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough =\nBears secondary. We don't recommend any of the three for Week 12.  Quincy C=\narter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday t=\nhat Carter will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Su=\nnday's game against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season=\n for Dallas, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. W=\ne don't recommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI -=\n The Hillrods Updated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Min=\nnesota with a pulled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against D=\netroit. Keep an eye on his progress during practice this week before you ma=\nke a final decision on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 1=\n1/26/01 Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hamstri=\nng problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game agains=\nt San Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on him=\n for Week 12.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - KMB Express Updated 11/26/01 Graham su=\nffered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is d=\nay to day.  Jason Broo! k! ins  , RB BAL - The Wounded Ducks Updated 11/26/=\n01 Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore w=\nill elevate Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi Ay=\nanbadejo as a backup.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - The Hillrods Updated 11/26/01=\n Barlow dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has n=\not been determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE - The Leather Cheerios Upda=\nted 11/26/01 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury o! n ! Sunday. His curr=\nent status is day to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/=\n26/01 Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Bucca=\nneers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarte=\nr of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Free Ag=\nent Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despi=\nte being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an inef=\nfective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the gam=\ne. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  =\nKeenan McCardell , WR JAC - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught s=\nix passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level=\n of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the=\n stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB J=\nAC - Xtreme U! pd! ated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and c=\naught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing,=\n Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail ,=\n WR BAL - She Said Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catche=\ns for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a=\n must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and=\n underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - The Wounded Du=\ncks Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonvil=\nle, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to b=\ne a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Cali Bou=\nnd Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against O=\nakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the se=\nason.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Barber r=\nushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passe! s ! fo=\nr 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still li=\nke to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB S=\nD - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, b=\nut he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 1=\n45 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   D=\noug Flutie , QB SD - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game,=\n throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's o=\nnly worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , Q=\nB ARI - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, po=\nsting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw =\ntwo picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , =\nWR ARI - The Hillrods Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game,=\n catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Di! eg! o. H=\ne's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth =\nstarting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Third World Countrym=\nan Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching=\n five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependab=\nle Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn=\n , WR NO - The Leather Cheerios Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid out=\ning, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a ver=\ny dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly bas=\nis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 11/25/01 In his return from =\na knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Croc=\nkett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not a=\nppear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even whe=\nn he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Ch=\narlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - She Said Updated 11/25/01 Smith had=\n 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a=\n slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footb=\nallers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Baby Blues Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge n=\numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. =\nHe's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will like=\nly keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon =\n, QB OAK - Pierres Flea Circus Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards,=\n three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked =\nconditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Foot=\nball.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left S=\nunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He =\nwas replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Mould=\ns , WR BUF - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an ex=\ntended slump, catchin! g ! six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Mia=\nmi. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Mo=\nulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if =\nhe follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  More U=\npdates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc=\n.

Updated 10/17/01 Corner=\nback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but=\n he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger o=\nf missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would repl=\nace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Dallas Demon Horde U=\npdated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game a=\ngainst Kansas City. He hasn't been ful! l ! speed at practice, however, so =\ndon't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free=\n Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice toda=\ny and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffe=\nrs is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR=\n CAR - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore =\nafter taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach Ge=\norge Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless hi=\ns status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consid=\ner be! nc! hing Muhammad if at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Lake=\n Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday=\n due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rook=\nie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarter=\nback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense=\n.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (h=\nand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday a=\ngainst New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a F=\nantasy! p! erspective.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Aryan Brother Inc. Upda=\nted 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expec=\nted to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's to=\no unreliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated=\n 10/17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesd=\nay. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest=\n his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job =\nin Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick ,=\n RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for th=\ne year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's show=\nn flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is stil=\nl minimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - High Shrivel Factor U=\npdated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Gre=\nen Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, w=\nith Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week. Ran=\ndy Moss , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as ques=\ntionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. Whi=\nle we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wou=\nldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  S=\nhane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Ma=\ntthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth addi=\nng to your Fantasy roster.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mul=\nlet! s ! Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Davis would like =\nto return to the lineup Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee i=\nnjury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November=\n 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development a=\nlso makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back.  Stacey=\n Mack , RB JAC - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of=\n carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gaine=\nd 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , W=\nR JAC - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled in his first fe=\nw games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game=\n. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.    S=\nean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a toug=\nh time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won=\n't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - High Shrivel F=\nactor Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and=\n is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw ! fo! r over 200 ya=\nrds and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brad=\ny is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is list=\ned as probable. He won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has =\nfive catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - The Replacements Updated=\n 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch=\n several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  ! He! rman Moore , =\nWR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the s=\neason after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. =\n\"We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,\" Lions Head C=\noach Marty Mornhinweg said. \"We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI s=\nhowed a significant tear in the muscle.\" Drop Moore if he was on your Fanta=\nsy team. Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wh=\neatley , RB OAK - Water Boys Updated 10/17/01 According to published report=\ns, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The vet=\neran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hur=\nt.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Co=\nsta Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as th=\ne team's \"workhorse\" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was repor=\nted to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry , RB BUF =\n- Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans =\nto have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis =\nin both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.  Jay R=\niemersma , TE BUF - South Park Cows Updated 1! 0/! 17/01 The Buffalo News s=\nays the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved in the offense now that t=\nackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy again. Riemersma was being =\nasked to block more often early in the year, but he will now become more in=\nvolved in the passing game.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - High Shrivel Factor U=\npdated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this =\nweek against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reg=\ngie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.  Dedric Wa=\nrd , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Herald says Ward had hi=\ns foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with stress protection. Th=\ne Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Blue S=\ntar Boys Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Star, Smith could=\n end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head=\n Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each other very well, a=\nnd that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day.  =\n Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/17/01 Alexa! nd! er =\nunderwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed a high s=\nprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to the injur=\ny, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Michael Pittm=\nan , RB ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered =\na concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tu=\nesday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionab=\nle, but he is expected to play.   Greg Clark , TE SF - Free Agent Updated 1=\n0/17/01 Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surg=\nery on his right hamstring three weeks ago. \"It was encouraging,\" Clark tol=\nd the Contra Costa Times. \"I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of tha=\n! t ! before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). Th=\ne most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in compar=\nison.\" Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy en=\nough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their=\n Oct. 28 game against Chicago.    More Updates  Player News Teams  [IMAGE] =\n CYSWC Player News  Derrick Alexander , Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Alexande=\nr overcame back problems to play against the Steelers, but was held to just=\n one catch for 10 yards. Injuries and lack of effective complements have re=\nndered Alexander a disappointment so far this season.  Darnay Scott , Activ=\ne WR Updated 10/14/01 Scott caught only one pass for five yards against the=\n Browns, but he scored on his only reception. Jon Kitna seems to favor Scot=\nt in the passing game, even though the final numbers haven't always reflect=\ned it.  Antonio Freeman , Active WR Updated 10/14/01 Freeman caught nine pa=\nsses for 138 yards and TD against Baltimore. His fine numbers against the A=\nFC's top defense are a clear signal that Freeman is still a quality Fantasy=\n wideout, despite his quiet start prior to this week.  Antowain Smith , Res=\nerve RB Updated 10/14/01 Smith rushed for only 36 yards in Sunday's win ove=\nr San Diego, but he did score a touchdown. He's still not a complete Fantas=\ny player, however, and is no better than a reserve used only when the match=\nup is right.   Derrick Mason , Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01 Mason (ankle and=\n shoulder) has been declared inactive for Week Six. Justin McCareins or Chr=\nis Sanders should start in his place.  Maurice Smith , Active RB Updated 10=\n/14/01 Smith rushed for 50 yards and a TD against the 49ers. Smith's yardag=\ne numbers won't be overwhelming the rest of the year, but he should continu=\ne to be a consistent TD threat.  Desmond Clark , Active TE Updated 10/12/01=\n Consider Clark as a starter this week. The Seahawks are soft over the midd=\nle and in the red zone, where Clark can be effective.  Jeff Garcia , Active=\n QB Updated 10/12/01 Garcia (elbow) is listed as probable for Sunday's game=\n against Atlanta. He'll post solid numbers against an inconsistent Falcons'=\n secondary, so be sure to start him this week.   Corey Dillon , Active RB U=\npdated 10/12/01 Look for Dillon to have mixed success this week. The Browns=\n defense will make it difficult to run but his effort as a receiver will be=\n enough to give him a productive week.   J.R. Redmond , Reserve RB Updated =\n10/12/01 Redmond is questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego due to=\n an ankle injury. He probably will miss this game due to the injury, which =\nmakes him virtually worthless Fantasy-wise.   Drew Bledsoe , Reserve QB Upd=\nated 10/02/01 According to the Boston Globe, there has been no upgrade in B=\nledsoe's timetable to return. He is still expected to miss the next two wee=\nks, so keep Bledsoe on reserve until he is healthy enough to play again.   =\nRaiders , Reserve DT Updated 10/02/01 The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstr=\nong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday=\n's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the =\ninjured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman=\n is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining =\na hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after a=\nggravating an injury to his right shoulder.   Bills , Active DT Updated 09/=\n30/01 Defensive end Phil Hansen left Sunday's game against Pittsburgh in th=\ne third quarter with an apparent wrist injury. He walked off the field and =\ninto the locker room to be examined, and his return is questionable.   Chad=\n Lewis , Reserve TE Updated 09/28/01 Lewis will have a good shot at produci=\nng some solid Fantasy numbers this week against Dallas. He's one of the lea=\ngue's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basi=\ns.   Ricky Proehl , Reserve WR Updated 08/19/01 Proehl has been dealing wit=\nh a slight hamstring injury in recent days, according to the St. Louis Post=\n-Dispatch. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Proehl is expe=\ncted to be ready for the start of the regular season.   Joe Nedney , Active=\n K Updated 03/07/01 The Tennessee Titans on Tuesday reached a contract agre=\nement with Nedney, an unrestricted free agent who played most of the 2000 s=\neason with the Carolina Panthers. The five-year veteran will replace longti=\nme Titans kicker Al Del Greco, who was cut last week after a poor postseaso=\nn performance and for salary cap reasons. Nedney converted 26 of 28 field-g=\noals attempts and all 20 of his extra-point tries for 98 points last season=\n.   Adam Vinatieri , Reserve K Updated 12/13/00 Vinatieri has been one of t=\nhe league's most accurate placekickers in recent weeks, converting on 18 of=\n his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his chances against the Bil=\nls this week, especially if Buffalo's defense struggles like it did on Mond=\nay night. Unless you have one of the league's elite kickers on your roster,=\n giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commi=\nssioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the \"Gridiron Guru.\"   \t[IMAGE]\tInside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   \t\n\n\n [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \t\n\n\n    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  \t\n\n\n    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  \t\n\n\n    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t\n\n\n  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  \t\n\n\n  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   \t\n\n\n  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   \t\n\n\n    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.    \t\n\n\n  This message has been sent to dutch.quigley@enron.com, provided free of charge and free of obligation.

But the C=\nhiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger ,=\n TE IND - The Wounded Ducks Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor i=\nn the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against=\n the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - =\nPumpdog Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at =\ntight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against N=\new England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Leather Cheerios Updat=\ned 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game again=\nst New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf th=\nis week.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expe=\ncted to ! st! art in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second cons=\necutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy=\n lineup.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Third World Countryman Updated 10/18/=\n01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Pa=\ntriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against Ne=\nw England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - KMB Express Updated 10/18/01 Manning =\ndid not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepte=\nd by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at ho=\nme this week.  Randy Moss  , WR MIN - Cali Bound Updated 10/18/01 Moss did =\nnot participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He shoul=\nd be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but ho=\nld off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be a=\nble to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Baby Blues Updated 10/18/01 Schroede=\nr missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment=\n and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether t=\no use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE! -! The Hillrods Updated 10/18/01=\n Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary migh=\nt have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layof=\nf didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - She Said Updated 10/=\n18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Col=\nts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in=\n his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - Baby Blues=\n Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He=\n could have a g! oo! d week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams.=\n He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan aroun=\nd Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 =\nColes has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down =\nby the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downf=\nield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Third World Countryman Updated 10/18/=\n01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Je=\nts will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen D=\navis , RB WAS - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/18/01  Davis had his first decent ga=\nme of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fant=\nasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an adva=\nntageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants considerati=\non.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very medi=\nocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 13=\n2 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster s=\npot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Third World C=\nount! ry! man Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this s=\neason, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some su=\nccess against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting =\nin deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Third World Countryman Upd=\nated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis=\n defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw h=\nis first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Upda=\nted 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of th! e ! work at tight end now th=\nat Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy considera=\ntion at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Ga=\nrdner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on=\n Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larg=\ner leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Pumpdog Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the p=\notential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday.=\n He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a=\n weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Cali Bound Updated 10/18/01 Bruce h=\nasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever cons=\nider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable =\nN.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Xtreme Updated 10/18/01 Con=\nwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. =\nHe's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tigh=\nt end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/18=\n/01 Canida! te! will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured b=\nack this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams=\n' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective=\n.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - The Hillrods Updated 10/18/01 Considering the hu=\nge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every=\n week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so =\nbe sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - The Wounded=\n Ducks Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be su=\nrprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the =\nGiants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckha=\nlter will likely be ! th! e more productive of the two backs.   Donovan McN=\nabb , QB PHI - 2700 HUEVOS Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantas=\ny players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should=\n beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be=\n sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Xtreme Update=\nd 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite tar=\ngets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary i=\ns a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated=\n 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained med=\nial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatl=\ney will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable fo=\nr Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PH=\nI - Third World Countryman Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at =\nproducing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He'=\ns one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup =\non a weekly basis.

DOWN LOAD NOW FOR FREE!\t\n\n\n [IMAGE] \t\t\n CLICK FOR WAR \tWAR  Rules of the Game: In the basic game there are two players and you use a standard 52 card pack. Cards rank as usual from high to low: A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Suits are ignored in this game.  Deal out all the cards, so that each player has 26. Players do not look at their cards, but keep them in a packet face down. The object of the game is to win all the cards. Both players now turn their top card face up and put them on the table. Whoever turned the higher card takes both cards and adds them (face down) to the bottom of their packet. Then both players turn up their next card and so on. \t\n [IMAGE] \t\t\n CLICK FOR SLOTS \tSLOTS  The Odds: The result of each spin of the wheels is determined by a computer program that generates random results. This is true for both online slots games and slot machines found in hotel casinos. The machines can easily be set by the casino to generate whatever payout they choose. For example, they may set it to 95%. That means for every 100 dollars bet, the machine will, on average, pay out 95 dollars. The other five dollars goes to the casino and that's how they make their profit. Of course, that's just on average. It's possible, if Lady Luck is on your side, to make hundreds or even thousands of dollars with just one spin\t\n [IMAGE] \t\t\n CLICK FOR ROULETTE \tROULETTE  The Odds: With the 38-number American wheel, the house has a big 5.26 percent edge. (Whenever 0 or 00 are hit, all bets lose.) With the 37-number European wheel, the house advantage is 2.7 percent. In other words, on every $100 bet the house makes $2.70. With the en prison rule, this edge drops to just 1.35 percent. Obviously you want to look for casinos that offer the European, single-zero wheel -- and many online casinos do. If you can find one that also offers en prison, so much the better.\t\n [IMAGE] \t\t\n CLICK FOR BLACKJACK \tBLACKJACK   Rules of the Game: Before any cards are dealt, the player must wager. He does this by placing his bet in the designated space in front of his table position. The dealer then deals two cards to each of the players, and two to himself (one of the dealer's cards is dealt face up and one is dealt facing down). Face cards (kings, queens and jacks) count as 10, ace counts as one or 11 (as the player chooses) and all other cards are counted at their face value.  If the player's first two cards are an ace and a 10 or face card, he wins. However, if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a standoff, as are all ties or pushes. A winning blackjack pays the player 3 to 2. \t\n\n\n CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD FOR FREE! \t\n\t\n\n\n You are subscribed and confirmed to this mailing as dutch.quigley@enron.com To unsubscibe from this list please go HERE \t\n"}

You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t\n\n\n  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  \t\n\n\n  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  \t\n\n\n  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  \t\n\n\n    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.  \t\n\n\n  This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored th=\ne Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after l=\neaving the game.    Derrick Alexander  , WR KC - She Said Updated 10/25/01 =\n  Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Ind=\nianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of =\nthe work in two receiver sets.    James Hodgins  , RB STL - Free Agent Upda=\nted 10/25/01   Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable f=\nor Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams off=\nense even if he is healthy.     Dave Stachelski  , TE NO - Free Agent Updat=\ned 10/25/01   The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one =\npass this season for five yards.     Michael Bennett  , RB MIN - The Hillro=\nds Updated 10/25/01   Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as qu=\nestionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but=\n his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green has=\nn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week.     Todd Heap =\n , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Heap is optimistic about playing =\nin Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since W=\neek Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserv=\ning him this week.     Anthony Thomas  , RB CHI - The Hillrods Updated 10/2=\n5/01   Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case o=\nf turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed=\n as probable on the injury report.     Kevin Swayne  , WR NYJ - Free Agent =\nUpdated 10/25/01   Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Way=\nne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start thi=\ns week.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swinto=\nn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated afte=\nr practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is heal=\nthy.     Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Ward has bee=\nn ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot=\n injury.     Terry Allen  , RB BAL - She Said Updated 10/25/01   Allen prac=\nticed Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to=\n The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive.=\n     Jason Brookins  , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Brookins has =\na minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actua=\nlly start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he i=\ns listed as probable on the injury report.     Shannon Sharpe  , TE BAL - K=\nMB Express Updated 10/25/01   Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is=\n expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury =\nreport.     Freddie Jones  , TE SD - She Said Updated 10/25/01   Jones has =\na sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as =\nquestionable on the injury report.     Hines Ward  , WR PIT - She Said Upda=\nted 10/25/01   Ward missed practice Wednesday because of a foot injury but =\nis expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as =\nprobable.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Gallo=\nway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice=\n. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previ=\nous game.     Charlie Batch  , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Batch=\n was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detro=\nit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the =\nBengals.     O.J. McDuffie  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Don't =\nexpect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he=\n is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie miss=\ned most of last season as well because of the injury.     Terrence Wilkins =\n , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Wilkins will not play in Sunday's=\n game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs.     Jerome Pathon  , W=\nR IND - Xtreme Updated 10/25/01   Pathon will miss his third straight game =\nThursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne w=\nill replace him in the starting lineup.     Terry Glenn  , WR NE - The Hill=\nrods Updated 10/25/01   Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, acco=\nrding to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednes=\nday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots wan=\nt to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday.     Drew Bledso=\ne  , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Boston Globe reports that th=\nere is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency=\n QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun thr=\nowing and doing individual passing drills.     Chad Morton  , RB NYJ - Free=\n Agent Updated 10/25/01   Morton might be able to play this Sunday, accordi=\nng to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an =\nankle sprain.     Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01  =\n Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury=\n but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , W=\nR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Johnson is making progress in his rec=\novery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he w=\nill be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the thi=\nrd receiver in his absence.     Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Update=\nd 10/25/01   Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Mo=\nnday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a=\n third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if =\nhe is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Xtreme Updated 10/25/01   Wh=\neatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but=\n head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making progre=\nss. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Eagles.     =\nKeyshawn Johnson  , WR TB - Baby Blues Updated 10/25/01   Johnson ran in th=\ne morning and afternoon but did not practice Wednesday, according to The St=\n. Petersburg Times . Johnson is recovering from hip and thigh injuries but =\nis expected to play Sunday.     Jacquez Green  , WR TB - 2700 HUEVOS Update=\nd 10/25/01   Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Minn=\nesota. He is recovering from a groin strain. Frank Murphy will replace Gree=\nn at receiver if he is unable to play.     Warrick Dunn  , RB TB - Third Wo=\nrld Countryman Updated 10/25/01   Dunn participated in running drills Wedne=\nsday and did not have any setbacks in his recovery from a toe injury, accor=\nding to The St. Petersburg Times . Nevertheless, Dunn is still listed as qu=\nestionable for this week's game against Minnesota.

He was already playing with a=\n sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. \"I will get an MRI =\nin the morning and go from there,\" Johnson said. \"Right now, they are sayin=\ng that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could n=\not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.\"   Emmitt Sm=\nith! , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01Smith pronounced himself OK =\ndespite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victor=\ny over Arizona on Sunday. \"It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll =\nbe all right,\" Smith said. \"I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know th=\ne degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.\"   But Smith was able to walk=\n off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at =\nthe New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on M=\nonday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    Daunte =\nCulpepper , QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 10/28/01 According to publi=\nshed reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tam=\npa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DE=\nN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time fo=\nr 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideo=\nut has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of produc=\ntivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Anderson ru=\nshed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score! o!=\n n an eight-yard run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 ti=\nmes for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Ander=\nson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - High Shrivel Factor Updated 10/28/01=\n Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should conti=\nnue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top t=\nwo receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/2=\n8/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carr=\nied the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat =\nagainst the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conwa=\ny , WR SD - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 =\nyards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he =\nis working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally per=\nforming up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - A=\nddison Red Cornholes Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to pl=\nay against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catc=\nhes was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers o=\nn short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight=\n end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - =\nThe Replacements Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving ya=\nrds on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball do=\nwnfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers f=\nrom Centers ecery week.  Peerless P! ri! ce  , WR BUF - The Replacements Up=\ndated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Dieg=\no. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to=\n start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Lake Aus=\ntin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, =\nthrowing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to h=\nave some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on i=\nmportant downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - Money Shots Updated 10/28/01 Th=\ne Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the streng=\nth of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but =\nhe also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage nu=\nmbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Or=\nonde Gadsden , WR MIA - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught =\nonly one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing=\n well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight  , =\nWR MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94=\n yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver cont=\ninues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Mone=\ny Shots Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries b=\ny Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should no=\nt start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Team T-B=\none Updated 10/28/01 ! To! omer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD a=\ngainst Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what t=\nhe opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Upda=\nted 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held ou=\nt of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Reds=\nkins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  T=\nony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards,=\n two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB i=\ns playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PH=\nI - Water Boys Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but wa=\ns held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 3=\n5 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should =\npost better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Bu=\nckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither bac=\nk is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie =\nGarner , RB OAK - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times fo=\nr 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put hi=\nm firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remai=\nns sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/28/01 G=\nannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sund=\nay's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' se=\ncondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  =\nDono! va! n McNabb  , QB PHI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/28/01 McNab=\nb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but h=\ne didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great =\nstats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. Mc=\nNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be=\n a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael =\nPittman , RB ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16=\n times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than =\nThomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliab=\nle Fantasy option for the remainder of the ! ye! ar.  David Boston , WR ARI=\n - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards =\nin Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent qua=\nrterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player beca=\nuse he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a so=\nlid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Team T-Bone Update=\nd 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interception=\ns in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be=\n. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for usef=\nul stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/=\n28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded t=\nwo sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewh=\nat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let th=\nis performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consist=\nent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updat=\ned 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns a=\nnd an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score i=\nn Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy=\n owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recomme=\nnd Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bl=\nue Star Boys Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late=\n in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushi=\nng yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF=\n - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quar=\nter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for furth=\ner examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned=\n.

He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) =\nhas come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, =\nhe'll play again.\" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to =\nstash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the jo=\nb back from Alexander down th! e ! stretch.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free A=\ngent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groi=\nn injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't=\n be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Lake =\nAustin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' sta=\nrting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle=\n Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck =\nas he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchu=\n! p ! for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week=\n.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have =\nlisted Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will =\nhave an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffere=\nd Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23=\n/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to m=\niss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this poi=\nnt in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01 Sm=\nith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to=\n play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin M=\ninnis , WR KC - Team T-Bone Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail=\n said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's ga=\nme against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite=\n the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is g=\noing to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - High Sh=\nrivel Fac! to! r Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game=\n Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this w=\neek.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Beer Gut Boys Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is=\n questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don=\n't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB=\n DEN - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting=\n Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic k=\nnee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whet! he! r they will activat=\ne him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by W=\nednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fant=\nasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running ba=\nck and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Team T-Bone Updated=\n 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstr=\ning strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in t=\nhe week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  =\n Duce Staley , RB PHI - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's=\n game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the =\nball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by roo=\nkie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11! c! arries late in the ga=\nme. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantas=\ny numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid repl=\nacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - CYSWC Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a ne=\nck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinne=\ny , TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injur=\ny report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this =\nweek's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01 Dyso=\nn is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's gam=\ne against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie G=\neorge , RB TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb i=\nnjury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve=\n McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a =\nsore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected =\nto play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated=\n 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his bac=\nk. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatmen=\nt options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders t=\no play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon =\nJones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume pr=\nacticing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would =\nnot require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - High S! hr! ivel Factor Updat=\ned 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore an=\nd his status for next week's game remains uncertain. \"All I know is that, f=\nrom week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,\" hea=\nd coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. \"It remains to be seen w=\nhen Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds wel=\nl this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return=\n date] next week.\" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his gro=\nin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 =\nNorthcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to pla=\ny when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Money =\nShots Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billic=\nk told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this=\n week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a s=\nprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - The Replacements Updated 10/23/01 A=\nllen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle,=\n is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running=\n back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL -! S! outh Park Cows Upd=\nated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's ga=\nme against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. \"I'm day-to-da=\ny. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,\" Grbac said Monday. \"There co=\nuld be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or=\n thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see.\" Randall Cunningham wil=\nl replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High=\n Shrivel Factor Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday=\n's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be availa=\nble for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL =\n- Barking Spiders Updated 10/23/01  According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatc=\nh, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend ag=\nainst New Orleans. \"I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,\" coa=\nch Mike Martz said. \"He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced=\n that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play.\" Ca=\nnidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets,=\n and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J=\n. Stokes , WR SF - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much=\n of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being complet=\nely healthy. \"Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing fo! =\nr ! me because I was able to get treatment every day,\" Stokes told the Cont=\nra Costa Times . \"I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent bu=\nt I'm darn close.\" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't us=\ne him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   =\nIke Hilliard , WR NYG - Dallas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard contin=\nues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. H=\nilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against=\n Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost =\ncompletely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon=\n missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprain=\ned ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Da=\nllas Demon Horde Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk=\n is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. \"I'm just taking th=\ne same posture that we did a week ago,\" Martz said. \"I would not expect Mar=\nshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'=\nll be convinced that we've got to let him play.\" Trung Canidate would once =\nagain start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

Wolkoff, Executive Vice President\n\nRE:\nAmendments to NYMEX End of Week Post-Close Trading Session Rule\n\nDATE:\nMay 4, 2001\n===========================================================\n\nPlease be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of changes to the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule that were recently approved by the Board will become effective.\n\nSpecifically, beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001 and continuing for subsequent Friday post-close sessions (and post-close sessions the day before a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:\n\n(1)\tContract months eligible for trading in these sessions will be expanded from the first four to the first 12 consecutive listed contract months.\n\n(2)\tThe sessions will be 5 minutes in duration.\n\n(3)\tThe trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above (below) the\ndaily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect):\n\nCrude Oil\t\t20 ticks\nHeating Oil \t\t50 ticks\nUnleaded Gas \t\t50 ticks\nNatural Gas\t\t50 ticks\n\nIf you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.\n\nAMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.57(\"POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION\") AND\nNYMEX RULE 6.57A (\"END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION\")\n\n(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)\n\nRule 6.57A.\t END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION\n\nOn the last trading day of the calendar week, and, in any week when an Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close trading session provided on the trading floor pursuant to Rule 6.57.  Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the \"End of Week Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of [ten (10)]  * five\n (5) * minutes in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the following conditions:\n\n(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first [four] * twelve * listed delivery months;\n\n(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable contract month for that futures contract * and as further expanded above the daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of the RTH session:\n\nContract\t\t\t\tAdditional Ticks\n\nCrude Oil\t\t\t\t20 ticks\nNatural Gas\t\t\t\t50 ticks\nUnleaded Gasoline\t\t\t50 ticks\nHeating Oil\t\t\t\t50 ticks *\n\n(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be submitted.\n\n(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be reported on public ticker services;\n\n(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week Session shall not be considered in determining any settlement price; and\n\n(F) Floor Members executing trades during the End of Week Session shall mark a line across their trading cards prior to the entry of an End of Week Session trade.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nPlease click on the link below to indicate you have received this\nemail.\n\n\"http://208.206.41.61/email/email_log.cfm?useremail=tana.jones@enron.com&refdoc=(01-150)\"\n\nNote: If you click on the above line and nothing happens, please copy\nthe text between the quotes, open your internet browser,\npaste it into the web site address and press Return.\n\n"}

Boo Williams and Lamont Hall will split time=\n at tight end in his absence.   Dez White , WR CHI - Team T-Bone Updated 11=\n/18/01 White (ankle) will start Sunday's game. He still may not do much aga=\ninst the Tampa Bay defense.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Money Shots Updated =\n11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) did not start in Sunday's game. Jamel White starte=\nd against the Ravens.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 11/18/0=\n1 McNair will start Sunday's game against Cincinnati as long after taking p=\nre-game snaps without any problems. McNair, who is dealing with a thumb inj=\nury, isn't worth starting on your Fantasy team outside of deeper leagues.  =\n Jacquez Green , WR TB - Barking Spiders Updated 11/18/0!  Green (abdominal=\n strain) is out for Sunday's game. Reidel Anthony will start in his absence=\n.  James Stewart , RB DET - South Park Cows Updated 11/18/01 Stewart (ankle=\n) is out for Sunday's game against Arizona. However, coach Marty Mornhinweg=\n stated that Stewart is making progress, and is getting closer to returning=\n to action.   Marco Battaglia , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Battag=\nlia (appendectomy) has been placed on injured reserve and is out for the re=\nmainder of the 2001 season. The ! bi! g tight end has no real value as a Fa=\nntasy player.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11/18/0=\n1 Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be fa=\ncing a tough Steelers' secondary at less than 100 percent, however, so Fant=\nasy owners may want to consider benching him in Week 10.   Fred Taylor , RB=\n JAC - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (groin) practiced without=\n incident on Friday, but he still needs medical clearance before he can pla=\ny in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Even is he is able to play, however,=\n he'd only be used on a limited basis. Stacey Mack will get the start in an=\ny event, so playing Taylor on your Fantasy team is not a wise move.   Jerom=\ne Pathon , WR IND - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/18/01 Pathon (foot) is ou=\nt for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to the Indianapolis Star=\n. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place once again.   James Jackson , R=\nB CLE - Money Shots Updated! 1! 1/18/01 Jackson (ankle) will likely be a ga=\nmetime decison on Sunday against Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unabl=\ne to play, Jamel White will be Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay =\ngetting some looks in the backfield as well.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI =\n- Water Boys Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weeken=\nd's game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of =\nthe game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal =\nLewis , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01!  According to published repor=\nts, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension we=\nnt into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabili=\ntate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will wo=\nrk toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB O=\nAK - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game w=\nith the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back.=\n Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN=\n - Water Bo! ys! Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck i=\ns expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him=\n a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money S=\nhots Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's gam=\ne against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball durin=\ng individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely t=\no play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week a=\ns a result.  Emmitt Smith  , RB DAL - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Smith=\n will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two ga=\nmes with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Fr=\niday's practice that Smith would \"be ready to play the majority of the game=\n.\" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend yo=\nu use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , =\nWR ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was add=\ned to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for=\n Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate fo=\nr a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' ! ma! tchup against a vu=\nlnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to pla=\ny.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to publ=\nished reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game ag=\nainst San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.=\n   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Culpeppe=\nr is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in =\nMinnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the=\n league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup o=\nn a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Money Shots Updated 11/16/01 Car=\nter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to =\never consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, a=\nnd should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' sec=\nondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - The Replacements Updated 11=\n/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants=\n due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's alm=\nost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy nu=\nmbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Blue Star Boys Updated 11/16/01 Williams =\nis one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to u=\nse on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been unde=\nrachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks  =\n, QB NO - The Replacements Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against S=\nan Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be=\n a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers mak=\nes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defe=\nnse.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 11/16/0=\n1 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11=\n catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis sq=\nuad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this wee=\nk is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets =\nUpdated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season s=\nlowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is onc=\ne again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 1=\n0 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony=\n Banks , QB WAS - Aryan Brother Inc. Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well=\n of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good=\n matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the =\nair, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michae=\nl Westbrook , WR WAS - Beer Gut Boys Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been in=\nconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his las=\nt four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable=\n at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gar=\ndner , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check =\nin his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does hav=\ne a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him=\n is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - High Shrivel Factor Updated 11=\n/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your=\n Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right.

{"text": "\nI know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.\n\nAfter weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.\n\nKen Lay"}

Bradford has yet to prove hims=\nelf as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Replacements Updated 1=\n0/21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his recept=\nions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six=\n games this year and has become a m! aj! or scoring threat even though he i=\ns not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - =\nCYSWC Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards r=\neceiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most=\n part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough =\nto bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Barking Spiders Updated 10/21/01 Gree=\nn threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green =\nhas been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starti=\nng nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - The Replacements Updated 10/2=\n1/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His num=\nbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has bee=\nn so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett c=\nannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Blue =\nStar Boys Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posti=\nng seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the =\nbest receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Mic=\nhael Pittman , RB ARI - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had =\na great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total of=\nfense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regula=\nrity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graha=\nm , WR SD - Water Boys Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego o=\nn Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver=\n. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's cert=\nainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Barking Spiders =\nUpdated 10/21/! 01!  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this se=\nason by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on t=\nhe day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desm=\nond Clark , TE DEN - CYSWC Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday,=\n catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been =\nreliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to=\n start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Blue Star Boys Upda=\nted 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) start! ed! Sunday's game against San Diego, =\nbut he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two in=\nterceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Blue Star Bo=\nys Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicag=\no. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he =\ndoes not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - CYSWC Updated 1=\n0/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the ve=\nteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.  Da=\nvid Terrell , WR CHI - Barking Spiders Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seve=\nn passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Ter=\nrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anth=\nony Thomas , RB CHI - Team T-Bone Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 ya=\nrds and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's =\ntop RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.=\n  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Water Boys Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven=\n passes for 100 yards and a T! D ! at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings u=\nntil this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Tita=\nns lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agen=\nt Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted=\n once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two cons=\necutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inco=\nnsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Money Shots Updated 10/21/01 McNair thr=\new for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed o=\nnly 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly ind=\nicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.!   Eddie George , =\nRB TEN - South Park Cows Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26=\n carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has c=\nertainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Ar=\nyan Brother Inc. Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yard=\ns and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inc=\nonsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumple=\nr , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78=\n yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick=\n tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Free Ag=\nent Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against At=\nlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Will=\nie Jackson , WR NO - Lake Austin Mighty Mullets Updated 10/21/01 Jackson fi=\nnished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the ! Fa! lcons=\n. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson=\n is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.   Hines Wa=\nrd , WR PIT - Blue Star Boys Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards =\non three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions fo=\nr the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's i=\nnability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Team T-B=\none Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered hi=\nm during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physic=\nal Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht  , TE NYJ - Dallas Demon Horde Update=\nd 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches fo=\nr 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but=\n his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position =\nlacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Money Shots Updated 1=\n0/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has d=\neveloped a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wid=\neout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jero=\nme Bettis , RB PIT - Addison Red Cornholes Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed f=\nor 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-y=\nard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against=\n any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Barking Spiders Updated 10/21/01 C=\nanidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of tot=\nal offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short=\n-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod=\n Gardner , WR WAS - Water Boys Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on =\nSunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He =\nseems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in =\nWashington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

{"text": "\nToday, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.\n\nWe made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.\n\nOver the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.\n\nFollowing are the highlights of our businesses:\n\nWholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).\nAmericas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).\nEurope and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.\n\nRetail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.\n\n\nTransportation and Distribution:\n\tNatural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.\nPortland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.\nGlobal Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.\n\nBroadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.\n\nCorporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.\n\nIn addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:\n?\tA $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.\n?\t$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.\n?\t$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  \n\nWith our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Get your fee to me in person or mail it to the following\naddress:\n\nBrian Dunlavy\n8073 El Mundo\nHouston, TX 77054\n\n\nQ2.  What is this?\nA2.  It's an NFL office pool.  Each week, you will select the winners\nof the NFL games straight up and assign a ranking of 15 to 1 for the\ngames (or 14, 13 if teams are off).  Your 15 game is your most\nconfident game while your 1 game is the game that you just can't\nfigure out.  If your team wins, then you get the number of points you\ndesignated to that team.  For example, New York Giants vs. Cleveland\nBrowns.  You select New York to win and rank them with 15.  They win,\nyou get 15 points.  They lose, you don't get any points.\n\nQ3.  Why are the rankings for the games important?\nA3.  Because that is how you win money!  Each week, the individual\nwith the highest score wins the weekly money which will be $50.  A\nrunning total of the scores is kept for the season and the rest of\nthe money will be paid to first through fifth place (possibly sixth\nplace).\n\nQ4.  How do I enter and play?\nA4.  The league name is \"H-Town Slaps\".  You can access the site at\nany time using the web address:\n\nhttp://football217.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/join?league=slaplist&\n\nNOTE: Once you get to the Join League Page, you will be asked to\nenter a password.  The password for this league is:\n\nkingme10\n\nOn the Join League page, select your name from the drop-down list. If\nyou don't see your name, select \"New Player\" and click Submit.\n\nRead over the rules for the league for further information.  If you\nhave any questions or concerns, please contact me.\n\nGood Luck!  Also, I don't have everyone's email addresses (especially\nthose who have played in the past) so please forward this email to\nyour friends who may be interested in playing.\n\nThanks,\nBrian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nMake international calls for as low as $.04/minute with Yahoo!

In light of this fact, I have tired not to bother the SME's and provide content for this project via other means.

With a maximum of two hours per week with Andy, it has been and will continue to be difficult to get all the help we need.

We will  still have a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise  players.  Then the non-franchise teams will pick in opposite order of  the supplemental round for round one...thus if you pick first in the  supplemental round, you will pick last (for those that did not keep  franchise players) in the first round.  Then, the teams that kept  franchise players will be randomly selected to pick at the end of the first  round.  After the first round, the draft will snake back the other way  with the last pick in the first round getting the first pick in the second  round and the draft will continue in this snake order until the end of the  draft.

According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis.  EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE.  Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds.

We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.\n\n2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  \n\n\"I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out\" \n\"It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade\" \n\"We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for\" \n\"We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type\" \n\"I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here\" \n\n\nFrom a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said \"they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. \n\nThe latest is the most disturbing:\n\n\"we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude\" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed\n\nWe do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the \"backoffice\"?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).\n\nWe have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  \n\nAll the problems are being caused by the following:\n\n1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.\n\nThere are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.\n\nMichelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.\n\n2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  \n\nWe also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.\n\n2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.\n\n2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. \n\n3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  \n\n4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "}
